<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />


<small>CALEB CONOVER WINS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The red-haired man was fighting.</p>

<p>He had always been fighting. The square jaw,
the bull neck proclaimed him of the battling breed;
even before one had scope to note the alert, light eyes,
the tight mouth, the short, broad hands with their
stubby strength of finger.</p>

<p>In prize ring, in mediaeval battlefield, in &#8217;longshore
tavern, Caleb Conover would have slugged his
way to supremacy. In business he won as readily&mdash;and
by like methods. His was not only the force
but also the supreme craft of the fighter. Therefore
he was president, instead of bouncer, in the offices
of the C. G. &amp; X. Railroad.</p>

<p>It was not railroad business that engrossed Conover
as he sat at his desk one day in early spring:
tearing open a ceaseless series of telegrams, scribbling
replies, ringing now and then for a messenger
to whom he gave a curt order.</p>

<p>Telegrams and messages ceased. In the lull, Conover
jumped to his feet and began to walk back and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
forth. His big hands were clenched, his head thrust
forward, his whole muscle-bound body tense.</p>

<p>Then began a violent ringing from the long-distance
telephone in the far corner of the room.
Conover picked up the receiver, grunted a question,
then listened. For nearly five minutes he stood thus,
the receiver at his ear, his broad, freckled face impassive
save for a growing fire in the pale, alert eyes.
A grunt of dismissal and the receiver was hung on
its hook.</p>

<p>Conover crossed the room, threw himself into a
big creaking chair, cocked his feet on the window
sill, drew out and lighted a fat cigar. The tenseness
was gone. His whole heavy body was relaxed. He
smoked mechanically and let his gaze rove with dull
inertness over the blank wall across the street. He
was resting as hard as he had fought.</p>

<p>A clerk timidly opened the door leading from the
outer offices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Caine, sir,&#8221; ventured the employee, &#8220;He
says he&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Send him in,&#8221; vouchsafed Conover without turning
his head.</p>

<p>His eyes were still fixed in unseeing comfort on the
wall, when his guest entered. Nor did he shift his
glance without visible reluctance. The newcomer
seemingly was used to his host&#8217;s lack of cordiality.
For, favoring Conover with a slight nod, he deposited
his hat, gloves and stick on the table and lighted a
cigarette, before speaking.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>Conover surveyed the well-groomed figure of his
visitor with an air of disparaging appraisal that
reached its climax as he noted the cigarette.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221; he suggested, &#8220;Throw away that paper
link between fire and a fool, and smoke real tobacco.
Try one of these cigars if you want to. They&#8217;ll fit
your mouth a lot better. Why does a grown man
smoke a&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This grown man,&#8221; replied Caine, unruffled, &#8220;has
a way of doing what he chooses. I came to see if
you were ready to go to your execution.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Execution, eh?&#8221; grinned Conover. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s
just on the books that there <i>may</i> be a little executin&#8217;
done, up there. But <i>I</i> won&#8217;t be the gent with his head
on the block. Besides, you&#8217;re an hour early.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I am. It&#8217;s an ideal day for work. So
I haven&#8217;t done any. I left the office ahead of time
and came to see if I could lure you into a walk before
we go to the Club. You don&#8217;t seem much worried
over the outcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I be? I&#8217;ll win. I always win.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Conover,&#8221; said Caine, observing his friend with
the condescendingly interested air of a visitor at the
Zoo, &#8220;If I had your sublime conceit I&#8217;d be President
of the United States or the richest man in
America, or some other such odious personage
whose shoes we all secretly fear we may some day
fill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;President? Richest man?&#8221; repeated Conover,
mildly attracted by the dual idea. &#8220;Give me time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
and I&#8217;ll likely be both. I&#8217;ve made a little start on the
second already, to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won another fight?&#8221; queried Caine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a big one. The biggest yet, by far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing to do with Steeloid, I suppose!&#8221; suggested
the visitor, a note of real concern peering
through his customary air of amused calm.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>All</i> about Steeloid,&#8221; returned Conover. &#8220;The Independent
Steeloid Company is incorp&#8217;rated at last.
Cap&#8217;talized at&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Independent! That means a slump in our
U. S. Steeloid! You call that winning a fight? I
thought&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d be better off, Caine, if you&#8217;d leave the
thinkin&#8217; part of these things to me. Thinkin&#8217; is my
game. Not yours. You talk about &#8216;our&#8217; U. S.
Steeloid. You seem to forget I swing seventy-two per
cent. of the stock and you own just what I let you in
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind all that,&#8221; interposed Caine. &#8220;If the
Independents are banded together, they&#8217;ll make things
warm for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not enough to cause any hurry call for electric
fans, I guess,&#8221; chuckled Conover. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll stop
&#8216;thinkin&#8217;&#8217; a minute or two an&#8217; listen to me, I&#8217;ll try to
explain. An&#8217; maybe I can hammer into your head
a few of the million things you don&#8217;t know about finance.
Here&#8217;s the idea. I built up the Steeloid
Trust, didn&#8217;t I? And Blacarda and his crowd who
had been running a bunch of measly third-rate Steeloid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
companies, set up a squeal because I could undersell
&#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; urged Caine. &#8220;I know all that. You
needn&#8217;t take a running start with your lesson in high
finance. We&#8217;ll take it for granted that I read at least
the newspaper I own and that I know Blacarda has
been trying to organize the independent companies
against you. What next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;re organized. Only Blacarda didn&#8217;t
do it. A high-souled philanthropic geezer that worked
through agents, jumped in an&#8217; combined all the independent
companies against us an&#8217; got &#8217;em to give him
full voting power on all their stock. Put themselves
into his hands entirely, you see, for the fight against
my Steeloid Trust. Then this noble hearted trust
buster incorporated the Independents. The deal went
through to-day. I got final word on it just now.
The Independents are organized. The votes on every
share of their stock is in the control of one man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; that &#8216;one man,&#8217;&#8221; resumed the Fighter,
&#8220;happens to be Caleb Conover.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; gasped the dumbfounded Caine, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Caine,&#8221; protested Conover, gently, &#8220;if all the
things you don&#8217;t understand about finance was to be
placed end to end&mdash;like they say in the Sunday
&#8216;features&#8217; of your paper,&mdash;they&#8217;d reach from here
to Blacarda&#8217;s chances of swingin&#8217; the Independent
Steeloid Company. An&#8217; that&#8217;s a long sight farther<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
than twice around the world. What I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; at is
this: I went to work on the quiet an&#8217; formed that
Independent Combine. Then I gave it to myself as a
present. It is now part of my U. S. Steeloid Company.
Or will be as soon as I can strangle the
Legislature kick that Blacarda&#8217;s sure to put up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see now,&#8221; said Caine, slipping back into his
armor of habitual calm, &#8220;and I take off my hat to
you. Conover, you missed your calling when you
failed to go into the safe breaking profession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s more money in business,&#8221; replied Conover
simply. &#8220;But now maybe you won&#8217;t lay awake
nights worryin&#8217; over your Steeloid stock. If it was
worth 170 2-5 this morning it&#8217;ll be quoted at 250 before
the month is out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder you aren&#8217;t afraid of this afternoon&#8217;s
ordeal,&#8221; observed Caine, &#8220;But Blacarda is on
the Board of Governors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So are you, for that matter,&#8221; said Conover, &#8220;and
I guess the vote of the man who&#8217;s made rich by Steeloid
will pair off with the vote of the man who&#8217;s broke
by it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; corrected Caine, &#8220;you don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s
because of my Steeloid holdings that I&#8217;m backing
you in this. I do it because it amuses me to see the
gyrations of the under dog. A sporting instinct, I
suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re pickin&#8217; <i>me</i> for the under dog,&#8221;&mdash;began
Conover, but broke off to stare in disgust at the other&#8217;s
upraised hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>Caine was lifting his cigarette to his lips. Conover
watched the lazily graceful gesture with more
than his wonted contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Caine,&#8221; he interrupted, &#8220;why in thunder do
you make your nails look like a pink skatin&#8217; rink?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you mean, why do I have them manicured,&#8221;
answered Caine, coolly, &#8220;it is absolutely none of your
business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I s&#8217;pose that&#8217;s what you&#8217;d call a snub,&#8221;
ruminated Conover, &#8220;But it don&#8217;t answer the question.
Pink nails all shined up like that may look first
rate on a girl. But for a man thirty years old&mdash;with
a mustache&mdash;Say, <i>why</i> do you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you wear a necktie?&#8221; countered Caine,
&#8220;I admit it is a surpassingly ugly one. But why
wear one at all? It doesn&#8217;t keep you warm. It has
no use.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clo&#8217;es don&#8217;t make a man,&#8221; stammered Conover,
rather discomfited at the riposte, &#8220;But there&#8217;s no use
creatin&#8217; a disturbance by goin&#8217; round without &#8217;em. As
for my necktie, it shows I ain&#8217;t a day laborer for one
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well-groomed hands are just as certain a sign
manual of another sort,&#8221; finished Caine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite get your meanin&#8217;. If&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a failure you would have been a success, Conover,&#8221;
interrupted Caine, &#8220;But as a success you are in
some ways a lamentable failure. To paraphrase your
own inspired words, if all the things you don&#8217;t know
about social usage were placed end to end&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>&#8220;They&#8217;d cover a mighty long list of measly useless
information. What do <i>I</i> care for such rot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what you&#8217;re called on to explain this afternoon
before the Governors of the Arareek Country
Club,&#8221; finished Caine rising. &#8220;Are you ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m going to stop at Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s for a few
minutes, first. I want to tell her about my winnin&#8217;
out against the Blacarda crowd. She knows Blacarda.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she know finance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As well as she knows Blacarda, I guess. An&#8217;
neither of &#8217;em enough to be &#8217;specially int&#8217;rested. But
she likes to hear about things I&#8217;ve done. I&#8217;ll just
drop &#8217;round there on my way. Join you later at the
Club.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll walk as far as her door with you, if you like,&#8221;
suggested Caine, gathering up his hat and stick.
&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll go on and see what I can do with the
Governors before the meeting. But I don&#8217;t look
forward to coercing many of them into sanity. They
bear a pitifully strong family resemblance to the late
lamented Bourbons. They &#8216;learn nothing, forget
nothing&#8217; and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they go your Bourbon gang one better,&#8221;
supplemented Conover, &#8220;by never havin&#8217; known anything
to start with. Maybe I can give &#8217;em an idea or
two, though, before we&#8217;re done. I used to boss Dago
section hands, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find this job rather more difficult, I fancy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
A garlick-haloed section hand is a lamb compared
to some of our hardshell club governors. Why do
you want to stay in the Club, anyhow? It seems to
me&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place because I won&#8217;t quit. Prov&#8217;dence
loves a bulldog, but He hates a quitter. In the
second place I want to feel I&#8217;ve as much right in that
crowd as I have in Kerrigan&#8217;s saloon. I&#8217;ve made my
way. This Steeloid shuffle ought to put me somewhere
in the million class. An&#8217; there&#8217;s more to come.
Lots of it. I&#8217;m a railroad pres&#8217;dent, too. The
C. G. &amp; X. is a punk little one-horse railroad; but
some day I&#8217;ll make it cover this whole State. The
road was on it last legs when I got hold of it, and I&#8217;m
making it what I choose to. Now, as a man with all
that cash,&mdash;and a railroad president, to boot,&mdash;why
ain&#8217;t I entitled to line up with the other big bugs of
Granite? Tell me that. They don&#8217;t want me, maybe?
Well, I&#8217;ll make &#8217;em want me, before I&#8217;m done.
Till then, they&#8217;ll take me whether they want me or
not. Ain&#8217;t that sound logic?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As sound as a dynamite cartridge,&#8221; laughed Caine,
&#8220;You&#8217;re a paradox! No, &#8216;paradox&#8217; isn&#8217;t a fighting
word, so don&#8217;t scowl. You have the Midas-gift of
making everything you touch turn to solid cash, and
making two dollars grow where one mortgage blank
formerly bloomed. You have the secret of power.
And, with it all, you stoop to crawl under the canvas
into the Social Circus. Feet of clay!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>Caleb glanced furtively at his broad, shining boots,
then, disdaining the allusion as past his discernment,
answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my own game and I play it as I plan to. In
one year from now you&#8217;ll see folks askin&#8217; me to the
same houses where <i>you&#8217;ve</i> been invited ever since
your great grandfather held down the job of &#8216;First
Land-owner&#8217; here, in the Revolution. See if I
don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever chance to read Longfellow&#8217;s poem
about the Rabbi&mdash;Ben Levi&mdash;who &#8216;took the Kingdom
of Heaven by violence?&#8217;&#8221; queried Caine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t read rhymes. Life&#8217;s too short. What
happened to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t have a particularly pleasant time of it,
as I remember. In fact, I believe the angels joined in
a symphonic clamor for his expulsion. Not unlike
the very worthy governors of the Arareek Country
Club.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; sniffed Conover in high contempt. &#8220;If
the Rabbi person had took the trouble of postin&#8217; himself
on those angels&#8217; pasts, he might a&#8217; got front-row
seat in the choir instead of bein&#8217; throwed out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So <i>that&#8217;s</i> the line you&#8217;re going to take with the
governors? I&#8217;m glad I decided to be there. It ought
to prove amusing. But you don&#8217;t seem to realize
that even if you win, you won&#8217;t be exactly beloved
by them, in future.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not expectin&#8217; a loving cup with a round-robin
of their names on it. Not just at first, anyhow. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
don&#8217;t waste any worry on me. The Club&#8217;s only the
first step, anyhow. The real fun&#8217;s liable to come
when I take another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Festina lente!</i>&#8221; counseled Caine, &#8220;People have
a way of forgetting a man is <i>nouveau riche</i> as long
as he remembers it. But they remember it as soon as
he forgets it. Is it discreet to ask what Miss Shevlin
thinks of all this? Is she in sympathy with your
social antics&mdash;I mean &#8216;ambitions?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I never asked her. I never
thought to. But if I did, she&#8217;d stand for it. You
see, not bein&#8217; as old and as wise as some of the Granite
folks, she&#8217;s fallen into the habit of thinkin&#8217; I&#8217;m just
about all right. It&#8217;s kind of nice to have someone
feel that way about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to return the compliment. I don&#8217;t
blame you. It isn&#8217;t every man who finds himself
guardian to an exquisite bit of animated Sevres china.
I&#8217;m lying back to watch for the time when some
scared youth comes to ask your leave to marry her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; snarled Conover, stopping and
glowering up at the tall, clean-cut figure at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get excited,&#8221; laughed Caine. &#8220;You can&#8217;t
expect as lovely and lovable a girl as Desir&eacute;e Shevlin
to live and die an old maid. If you&#8217;re so opposed to
this imaginary suitor I&#8217;ve conjured up, why not marry
her yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry? That kid? <i>Me?</i>&#8221; sputtered Conover,
&#8220;Why I&#8217;m past thirty an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217; she ain&#8217;t twenty yet.
Besides I&#8217;m a daddy to her. If I hear of you or anyone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
else queerin&#8217; that kid&#8217;s fondness for me by any
such fool talk, I&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her father was wise in appointing you her guardian,&#8221;
mocked Caine. &#8220;In the absence of man-eating
blood-hounds or a regiment of cavalry, you&#8217;re an ideal
Dragon. I remember old Shevlin. A first rate contractor
and ward politician; but the last sort of man
to have such a daughter. As for Billy, now&mdash;he&#8217;s
the model of his father. A tougher little chap and a
greater contrast to his sister could hardly be imagined.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She takes after her mother,&#8221; explained Conover,
puffing mightily at a recalcitrant cigar; &#8220;Mother
was French. Came of good people, I hear. Named
her girl Desir&eacute;e. French name. Kind of pretty
name, too. Died when Billy was born. I s&#8217;pose
that&#8217;s why the boy was named for his dad, instead of
being called Pe-air or Juseppy or some other furren
trademark. That&#8217;s why he&#8217;s tough too. Desir&eacute;e was
brought up. Billy&#8217;s bringing himself up. Same as I
did. It&#8217;s the best trainin&#8217; a boy can have. So I let
him go his own gait, an&#8217; I pay for the windows he
smashes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did Old Man Shevlin happen to leave you
guardian of the two children? Hadn&#8217;t he any relatives?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None but the aunt the kids live with. I s&#8217;pose
he liked me an&#8217; thought I&#8217;d give the girl a fair show.
An&#8217; I have. Convent school, music an&#8217; furren lingoes
an&#8217; all that rot. An&#8217; she&#8217;s worth it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>&#8220;How about Billy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no concern of mine. He gets his clothes
an&#8217; grub an&#8217; goes to public school. It&#8217;s all any boy&#8217;s
got a right to ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Contractors are like plumbers in being rich past
all dreams of avarice, aren&#8217;t they? One always gets
that idea. The Shevlins will probably be as rich as
cream&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll have what they need,&#8221; vouchsafed Conover.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re doing all this on the money that
Shevlin left?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure! You don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose I&#8217;d waste my own cash
on &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a clumsy liar you are!&#8221; observed Caine
admiringly. &#8220;There! There! In this case &#8216;liar&#8217;
is no more a fighting word than &#8216;paradox.&#8217; Don&#8217;t
get red.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you drivin&#8217; at?&#8221; demanded Conover.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only this: The wills and some other documents
filed at the Hall of Records, are copied by our men
and kept on file in our office. I happened to be going
over one of the books the other day and I ran across
a copy of old Shevlin&#8217;s will. There was a Certificate
of Effects with it. He left just $1,100, or, to be accurate,
$1,098.73.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; challenged Conover.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; echoed Caine, &#8220;The rent of the house
where Miss Shevlin lives, her two servants, and her
food must come to several times that sum each year.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
To say nothing of the expenses and the support of the
aunt, who lives with her. None of those are on the
free list. You&#8217;re an awfully white chap, Conover.
You went up about fifty points in my admiration when
I read that will. Now don&#8217;t look as if I&#8217;d caught
you stealing sheep. It&#8217;s no affair of mine. And as
she doesn&#8217;t seem to know, I&#8217;m not going to be the
cheerful idiot to point out to her the resemblance between
her father&#8217;s $1,100 and the Widow&#8217;s Cruse.
It&#8217;s pleasure enough to me, as a student of my fellow
animals, to know that a pirate like you can really once
in your life give something for nothing. There&#8217;s the
house. Don&#8217;t forget you&#8217;re due at the Club in fifty
minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Conover, red, confused, angry, mumbled a word of
goodbye and ran up the steps of a pretty cottage that
stood in its own grounds just off the street they were
traversing.</p>

<p>Caine watched the Fighter&#8217;s bulky form vanish
within the doorway. Then he lighted a fresh cigarette
and strolled on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he ruminated, &#8220;what his growing list
of financial victims would say if they knew that Brute
Conover worships as ideally and reverently as a Galahad
at the shrine of a little flower-faced nineteen-year
old girl? But,&#8221; he added, in dismissing the quaint
theme, &#8220;no one of them all would be half so surprised
to know it as Conover himself!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>THE GIRL</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Conover lounged back and forth in the pretty little
reception room of Desir&eacute;e Shevlin&#8217;s house, halting
now and then to glance with puzzled approval at some
item of its furnishings. The room&mdash;the whole house&mdash;was
to him a mystery. Contentedly devoid of
taste though he was, the man dimly realized the charm
of the place and the dainty perfection of its appointment.
That Desir&eacute;e had accomplished this in no way
astonished him. For he believed her quite capable
of any minor miracle. But in it all he took a pride
that had voiced itself once in the comment:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you could make a room look so
nice without a single tidy or even a bow fastened up
anywhere. But why did you get those dull old tiles
for your mantel? I wouldn&#8217;t a&#8217; kicked at payin&#8217; for
the best marble.&#8221;</p>

<p>To-day, Conover gave less than usual homage to
the apartment. He was agog to tell its owner his
wonderful tidings, and he chafed at her delay in appearing.
At last she came&mdash;the one person on earth
who could have kept Caleb Conover waiting; without
paying, by sharp reproof, for the delay.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I was so long,&#8221; she began as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
brushed the curtains aside and hurried in, &#8220;But Billy
and I couldn&#8217;t agree on the joys of tubbing. I&#8217;d hate
to hate anything as much as he hates his bath. Now
you&#8217;ve had some good luck! Glorious, scrumptious
good luck! I can tell by the way your mustache is
all chewed. You only chew it when you&#8217;re excited.
And you are only excited when something good has
happened. Isn&#8217;t it clever of me to know that? I
ought to write it up: &#8216;Facial Fur as a Bliss Barometer.&#8217;
How&mdash;Oh, I didn&#8217;t mean to be silly when
you&#8217;re bursting with news. Please be good and tell
me. Is it anything about Steeloid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s <i>all</i> about Steeloid,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve won
out&mdash;I&#8217;ve made my pile.&#8221;</p>

<p>She caught both his hands in hers, with a gesture
almost awkward in its happy impulsiveness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m <i>so</i> glad! So <i>glad</i>!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Tell
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Boyishly, bluntly, eagerly, Conover repeated his
story.</p>

<p>His florid face was alight, enthusiasm wellnigh
choking him. She heard him out with an excitement
almost as great as his own. As he finished she
clapped her hands with a little laugh of utter delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, splendid!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;No one but
you would ever have thought of it. It&#8217;s&mdash;&#8221; her
flush of pleasure yielding momentarily to a look
of troubled query&mdash;&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly&mdash;<i>honest</i>, of
course?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s business,&#8221; he replied.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s the same thing, I suppose,&#8221; she said, much
relieved, &#8220;And you&#8217;re rich?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A million anyway. And you&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Hell!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Both turned at the wonder-inspired, sulphurous
monosyllable. Desir&eacute;e jerked the curtain aside, revealing
a stocky small boy, very red of face. He was
clutching a blue bath robe about him and had no apparent
aim in life save to escape from the situation
into which his involuntary expletive had betrayed
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t go callin&#8217; me down, Dey,&#8221; he pleaded.
&#8220;I just happened to be going past&mdash;I was on the
way to take my bath, all right&mdash;on the level I was&mdash;an&#8217;
I heard Mr. Conover say about havin&#8217; a million.
An&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217;&mdash;I spoke without thinkin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had been edging toward the stair-foot as he
talked. Now, finding the lower step behind him, he
fled upward on pattering desperate feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Billy!&#8221; laughed Desir&eacute;e, &#8220;He&#8217;s an awfully
good little chap. But he <i>will</i> listen. I can&#8217;t break
him of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe <i>I</i> could,&#8221; hazarded Conover.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d break his neck and his heart at the same
time. Leave him to me. Nothing but kindness does
any good where he is concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever try a bale-stick?&#8221; suggested Caleb.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do!&#8221; she reproved. &#8220;Now, I want
to hear more about Steeloid. Poor Mr. Blacarda!
It&#8217;s pretty hagorous for him, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>&#8220;If &#8216;hagorous&#8217; means he&#8217;s got it in the neck, it
is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hagorous&#8217;&#8221; explained Desir&eacute;e, loftily, &#8220;means
anything horrid. I know, because I made it up. It&#8217;s
such a comfort to make up words. Because then, you
see, you can give them meanings as you go along. It
saves a lot of bother. Did you ever try it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Conover, apologetically. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid
I never did. Maybe I could, though, if it&#8217;d make a
hit with you. But you were talkin&#8217; about Blacarda.
You ain&#8217;t wastin&#8217; sympathy on <i>him</i>, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for anyone that gets the worst of it.
But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But no sorrier for Blacarda than you would be
for anybody else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He comes here a lot. Twice I&#8217;ve met him here.
Is he stuck on you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess most people are,&#8221; sighed Caleb. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
blame him; so long as you don&#8217;t care about him.
You don&#8217;t, do you?&#8221; he finished anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s very handsome,&#8221; she observed demurely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;pretty handsome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s&mdash;I&#8217;ve heard girls say so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! Nice crimson lips, red cheeks, oily curled
hair and eyes like a couple of ginger snaps!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; corrected Desir&eacute;e, judicially, &#8220;More like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
chocolate pies. There&#8217;s something very sweet and
melting about them. And, besides, you mustn&#8217;t run
him down. He&#8217;s very nice to me. Last night he
asked me to marry him. What do you think of <i>that</i>?
Honestly, he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The measly he-doll! I wish I&#8217;d broke him a
year ago instead of waiting for the Steeloid scrap.
What&#8217;d you say when he asked you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your face gets such a curious shade of magenta
when you are angry, Caleb,&#8221; mused Desir&eacute;e, observing
him critically, her head on one side. &#8220;But it
doesn&#8217;t match your hair a little bit. There, I didn&#8217;t
mean to tease you. Yes, I did mean it, too, but I&#8217;m
sorry. I told him I couldn&#8217;t marry him, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good work!&#8221; approved Caleb, &#8220;What&#8217;d he say
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&mdash;he asked if I&#8217;d try and look on him as a
brother&mdash;&#8216;a dear brother,&#8217; and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She broke off with a reminiscent laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what did you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I was a little rude. But I didn&#8217;t mean
to be. I&#8217;d heard a smothered giggle from over in
the corner. So I told him if I&#8217;d really had any use
for a brother&mdash;a &#8216;dear brother,&#8217;&mdash;I could reach right
behind the divan and get one. He stalked over to the
divan. And sure enough there, behind the cushions,
was Billy, all wudged up in a little heap. He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All&mdash;<i>what</i>?&#8221; asked the perplexed Conover,
pausing in the midst of a Homeric guffaw.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Wudged.&#8217; All wudged up&mdash;like this&mdash;&#8221; crumpling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
her ten fingers into a white, compact little bunch.
&#8220;Mr. Blacarda was very angry. He went away.&#8221;</p>

<p>She joined for an instant in Conover&#8217;s laughter;
then checked herself with a stamp of her foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; she ordered. &#8220;I&#8217;m a little beast to behave
so. He&mdash;cared for me. He asked me to marry
him. There ought to be something sacred in all that.
And here I am making fun of him. Caleb, <i>please</i> say
something to make me more ashamed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right, girl!&#8221; chuckled Caleb in huge
delight. &#8220;Poor pink-an&#8217;-white Blacarda! You
were&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t! I ought to be whipped for telling you.
But&mdash;but somehow, I seem to tell you everything.
Honestly, I wouldn&#8217;t tell anyone else. Honestly!
You <i>know</i> that, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;re the whitest, brightest, jolliest kid
that ever happened,&#8221; returned Conover, &#8220;but you
needn&#8217;t bother about Blacarda. I won&#8217;t tell. Now
I&#8217;ve got to get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to take me for a walk or a drive
or anything? It&#8217;s such a gorgeous day, and it&#8217;s so
early. Almost as early as it ever gets to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t, worse luck!&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a measly
appointment at the Arareek. An&#8217; besides&mdash;say, little
girl, I don&#8217;t know about walking or driving with
you any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Caleb!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, till I explain. Now that Mrs. Hawarden&#8217;s
took such a fancy to you an&#8217; took you up an&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
chap&#8217;roned you to places where I&#8217;d be chased out with
a broom&mdash;an&#8217; all that&mdash;well, you get invited to big
folks&#8217; houses. That&#8217;s how you met Blacarda, wasn&#8217;t
it? He travels with the gold-shirt crowd. Now, that
crowd don&#8217;t care about me. They will, some day.
But they don&#8217;t, yet. An&#8217; if you&#8217;re seen around with a
rank outsider like me&mdash;it&#8217;ll&mdash;it may kind of make
&#8217;em think you&#8217;re the same sort <i>I</i> am. An&#8217; that&#8217;ll be
liable to queer you with &#8217;em. An&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Caleb Conover!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped, thoroughly uncomfortable, yet vaguely
glad of having eased his mind of its worry for her
prospects. She was frowning up at him with all the
menacing ferocity of an Angora kitten.</p>

<p>&#8220;Caleb Conover!&#8221; she repeated, in stern rebuke.
&#8220;Aren&#8217;t <i>you</i> ashamed? Aren&#8217;t you <i>ashamed</i>? <i>Say</i>
you are! Now go and stand in the corner. If I ever
hear you talk that way about yourself again&mdash;why
<i>Caleb</i>! We&#8217;re <i>chums</i>, you and I. Don&#8217;t you know
that I&#8217;d rather have you than all those people put together?
Now talk very fast about something else,
or I won&#8217;t get my temper back again. What&#8217;s your
appointment about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the Arareek?&#8221; he asked, falling in, as ever,
with her lightning change of mood. &#8220;Oh, nothing
much. It&#8217;s a meeting of the Board of Governors.
There&#8217;s a man in the Club who got in by influence, before
they realized just what sort of a punk feller he
was. An&#8217; now they&#8217;ve called a meeting to see about
kickin&#8217; him out. There&#8217;s to be a vote on it. An&#8217; he&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
to appear before &#8217;em to-day to defend himself. Not
quite reg&#8217;lar in Club by-laws, Caine tells me. But
that&#8217;s what&#8217;s to be done. They say: &#8216;his business
methods bring disrepoote on the Club.&#8217; That&#8217;s the
sp&#8217;cific charge I b&#8217;lieve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what have <i>you</i> got to do with all that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217;&mdash;Except I&#8217;m the shrinkin&#8217; victim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You! Is it&mdash;a joke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not on me. I&#8217;ll fix it all right. Don&#8217;t you worry
now. I wouldn&#8217;t a&#8217; told you about it if I hadn&#8217;t
known I&#8217;d win out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re <i>sure</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I am. What chance has that bunch of
mutton-heads against anyone with man&#8217;s size brains in
his skull? Sure, I&#8217;ll win. Now, don&#8217;t look like that,
Dey. It breaks me all up to have you blue. I tell
you it&#8217;ll be all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are the Governors?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your friend Blacarda is one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! That&#8217;s bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only counts one vote. And Caine&#8217;s another.
He&#8217;s on my side. He has more pull with those people
than Blacarda.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder why you and Mr. Caine are such friends.
There never were two other men as different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He owns the biggest noospaper in Granite, an&#8217; he
belongs to one of the top-notch families. So he&#8217;s a
power in his own way, for all he&#8217;s such an odd fish.
&#8216;Eccentric&#8217; they call it, don&#8217;t they? Why do we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
travel together? That lazy don&#8217;t-care way of his and
his trick of twistin&#8217; sentences upside down an&#8217; then
callin&#8217; &#8217;em &#8216;epigrams&#8217; is kind of amoosin&#8217;. Besides,
he&#8217;s of use to me. That explains my side of it. I&#8217;m
of use to him. That explains his. He&#8217;ll more&#8217;n offset
Blacarda.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are the rest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hawarden&#8217;s one. Husband of your chap&#8217;rone
friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wish I&#8217;d known! I&#8217;d have asked her to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s nec&#8217;ssary,&#8221; evaded Caleb.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll be all right, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you knew him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more I do. But I&#8217;ve an idea he&#8217;ll vote for
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the same I wish I&#8217;d asked Mrs. Hawarden to
make him do it. She&#8217;s been so nice to me, I&#8217;m sure
she&#8217;d have done me one more favor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice to you, is she? Reelly nice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a dear. Just think of a woman in her position
hunting me out and making friends with me and
asking me all the time to her house and introducing me
to people who wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have even poked me
with a silver handled umbrella! Nice? I should
think she was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; drawled Conover, solemnly, &#8220;I guess she
must be. Old Reuben Standish is one of the Governors,
too. Know him? President of the Aaron
Burr Bank. Big society bug, tradin&#8217; on fam&#8217;ly that&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
dead an&#8217; fortune that&#8217;s dribbled through his fingers.
Sort of man that&#8217;s so stiff he never unbends till he&#8217;s
broke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ve met him,&#8221; reflected Desir&eacute;e. &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t
he look just a little like a rail? Gray and long and
mossy&mdash;with a sort of home-made face? And one
eye that toes in just a little?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the man,&#8221; grinned Caleb in high approval.
&#8220;There&#8217;s two kinds of financiers: the thick-necked, red-faced
kind, with chests that have slipped down;&mdash;an&#8217;
the cold gray kind. Gray hair, gray eyes, gray skin,
gray clothes an&#8217; gray mustache. Gray souls, too.
That sort never take on weight. An&#8217; there&#8217;s just
enough humanness in their faces to put you in mind
of the North Pole. Thank the Lord, I&#8217;m one of the
thick, red breed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean all over or just your head?&#8221; queried
Desir&eacute;e innocently, as she glanced at his stiff,
carroty hair. &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s awfully nice of you to laugh
at my poor little jokes. I wonder what you&#8217;d do if
you ever met a really clever woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose I&#8217;d begin figurin&#8217; out how stupid she&#8217;d
frame up alongside of you,&#8221; he answered simply.
&#8220;You see, I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were talking about Mr. Standish. Is he going
to vote for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As I lent his bank $96,000 last year when it was
shaky from a run, I guess he is. Not that he&#8217;s over-grateful.
But his bank&#8217;s in a bad way again and he&#8217;s
li&#8217;ble to need me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>&#8220;So you are going to discount his future gratitude?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so. He needs me. An&#8217;&mdash;I need him. Not
only for to-day, but for a plan I&#8217;ve been thinkin&#8217; over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could help you with him. I&#8217;ve met his
daughter, Letty, once or twice. They say she&#8217;s engaged
to Mr. Caine. Mrs. Hawarden tells me they&#8217;ve
been in love with each other ever since she stopped
playing with dolls. I should have hated to give up
dolls just in exchange for Mr. Caine. Are there any
more Governors?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A few. None that you know. I must be off.
Now, remember, you aren&#8217;t to worry. It&#8217;s all right.
I wouldn&#8217;t bother to keep in the Club if it was like
most places of that kind. But it isn&#8217;t. The Arareek&#8217;s
an institootion in Granite. If you ain&#8217;t in it,
you&#8217;re nobody. An&#8217; at Ladies&#8217; Days an&#8217; times like
that, the Big people always show up. It&#8217;s a good
thing to belong. Besides, a feller gets lots of new
experience by joinin&#8217; a country club. F&#8217;r instance, I
never knew what reel lonesoneness was till I went to a
few of their Ladies&#8217; Days an&#8217; Field Days. I might
as well a&#8217; been on a desert island.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor boy! It&#8217;s a burning shame! Why do
you&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it ain&#8217;t always goin&#8217; to be like that. Don&#8217;t be
sorry about it. I&#8217;ll whip &#8217;em into shape before I&#8217;m
done.&#8221;</p>

<p>The soaring, clear song of a canary broke in on his
boast. Beginning with a faint, barely audible trill, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
rose in a glorious piercing crescendo of melody; hung,
vibrated, scaled a whole octave, then ceased as
abruptly as it had begun.</p>

<p>Caleb turned toward the window between whose
curtains swung a cage. The occupant, a ball of golden
fluff, barred with gray-green, hopped self-importantly
from perch to perch, nervously delighted with the
man&#8217;s scrutiny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said Conover. &#8220;When&#8217;d you get that?
I never saw him before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He came yesterday,&#8221; explained Desir&eacute;e. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t
he a little darling? Jack Hawarden sent him to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That kid? You don&#8217;t mean to say <i>he&#8217;s</i> stuck on
you, too? Why he&#8217;s barely twenty-one an&#8217; he can&#8217;t
earn his own livin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a real pleasure, Caleb, to hear your fulsome
praise of the men I happen to know. First Mr. Blacarda,
and now&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what&#8217;s called &#8216;sarcasm,&#8217; ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked
Conover. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to rile you. I guess young
Hawarden&#8217;s all right,&mdash;as far&#8217;s college let him learn
to be. What&#8217;s the bird&#8217;s name? Or don&#8217;t birds have
names?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? Had you thought of one for him? How
would &#8216;Steeloid&#8217; do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Caleb&#8217;s grin of genuine delight at the suggestion
made her add quickly with more tact than truth:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I&#8217;d thought of that before. How silly of
me not to! For, you see he&#8217;s already named now.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>&#8220;Oh, he is, hey?&#8221; said the discomfited Conover.
&#8220;Who named him? Hawarden?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Billy and I. His name&#8217;s Siegfried-Mickey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a crazy name for a&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, isn&#8217;t it? That&#8217;s why I like it so. Billy
wanted to call him &#8216;Mickey&#8217; after the bulldog he used
to have. And <i>I</i> wanted to call him Siegfried. So we
compromised on Siegfried-Mickey. He&#8217;s a dear. He
knows his name already. Don&#8217;t you, Siegfried
Mickey?&#8221;</p>

<p>The bird, thus adjured, maintained a severely non-committal
dumbness.</p>

<p>&#8220;See!&#8221; triumphed Desir&eacute;e, &#8220;Silence gives assent.
He&#8217;s a heavenly little singer. Why, only this morning,
he sang nearly all the first bar of &#8216;<i>The Death of
Ase</i>&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The which?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>The Death of Ase.</i>&#8217; In the Peer Gynt suite, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! Of course. Sure!&#8221; mumbled Caleb
hastily. &#8220;I was thinkin&#8217; of some other feller&#8217;s suite.
An&#8217; he sang <i>that</i>, did he? The clever little cuss!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t he, though? And he&#8217;d only heard me
play it once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty hard thing to sing, too!&#8221; supplemented
Caleb, wisely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Caleb Conover,&#8221; she rebuked in cold admonition,
&#8220;Look at me! No, in the eyes! <i>There!</i> Now, how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
often have I told you not to make believe? You treat
me just as if I was a child. <i>Why</i> do you pretend to
know about &#8216;<i>The Death of Ase</i>,&#8217; you dear old simple
humbug? Don&#8217;t you know I <i>always</i> find you out
when you&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want you to think I wasn&#8217;t up on the
things that int&#8217;rest you, girl,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;It&#8217;s rotten
to feel you&#8217;ve got to talk down to me every time
you speak about music or litterchoor or those things.
An&#8217;&mdash;Lord! but I do hate to let on when I don&#8217;t understand
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You understand more of the <i>real</i> things&mdash;the
things that are worth while&mdash;than any other man
alive,&#8221; she protested. &#8220;Now say goodbye and run
on, or you&#8217;ll be late. Don&#8217;t forget to stop on the way
back and let me know whether the lions eat Daniel or
if Daniel&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eats the lions? I don&#8217;t know who Dan&#8217;l was, but
this ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to be that kind of a show. It&#8217;ll just be
a sheep-killin&#8217; contest. An&#8217; <i>I</i> never was built to play
the alloorin&#8217; role of Sheep. So you can figger out
who&#8217;ll be killer an&#8217; who&#8217;ll get the job of <i>killee</i>.&#8221;</p>

<small>CALEB CONOVER FIGHTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Granite&#8217;s social life revolved about the Arareek
Country Club. Granite felt a guilty pride when its
more sensational preachers railed against the local
preference for spending Sunday morning on the Arareek
links or on the big clubhouse veranda, rather
than in church pews. Granite social lights flared dazzlingly
at the Club&#8217;s dances. Granite men chose the
Arareek smoking room as a lounging place in preference
to the more exclusive Pompton Club&#8217;s apartments.
Situated a half mile beyond the growing city&#8217;s borders,
the Arareek clubhouse lay in the centre of a narrow
valley, whence its grounds radiated in all directions.</p>

<p>Thither, Conover, after his talk with Desir&eacute;e Shevlin,
bent his steps. Caleb had been no less amazed
than delighted when Caine, a year or so earlier, had
succeeded in engineering his election to the Arareek.
The Club had been in need of money and was therefore
the less inquisitorial as to the character of candidates.
Conover was then unknown to most of its
members. With a half score of innocuous nobodies
he had been admitted. The combined initiation fees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
had lifted the Arareek momentarily from its financial
trouble.</p>

<p>Now, with much the excitement of a shoal of minnows
to whose pool a pickerel has found ingress, the
club&#8217;s Governors were seeking to correct their error
of negligence. A committee had been appointed to
take semi-formal testimony in the case, to overrule
whatsoever defense Conover might seek to make and
to report to the Board in favor of the unwelcome
member&#8217;s rejection. The exact mode of transaction
was out of rule, from a standpoint of rigid club standards.
But the Arareek, as its members boasted, was
less an actual club than a phase of local society, and as
such was a law unto itself.</p>

<p>On the veranda, as Caleb arrived, several members
were seated, watching a putting match on the &#8220;green&#8221;
that stretched betwixt porch and tennis courts. One
or two women were among the onlookers. From the
awkward hush that fell on the group as he ascended
the steps, Conover deduced the trend of the talk his
presence had checked. He glanced in grim amusement
from one averted or expressionless face to another;
then, singling out Caine with a nod, passed in
through the low, broad doorway. Caine tossed away
his cigarette, smiled non-committally in reply to a bevy
of questioning looks, and followed his proteg&eacute;e into
the building.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re waiting for you,&#8221; said he, catching up
with Conover. &#8220;The Committee went to its room
five minutes ago, pacing in single file like the Court of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Priests in <i>Aida</i>. Can&#8217;t you manage to tremble a little?
It seems hard that so much really excellent pomposity
should be wasted on a man who doesn&#8217;t care.
Why are you late?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always late to an appointment,&#8221; answered
Conover. &#8220;Make the other fellow do the waitin&#8217;.
Don&#8217;t do it yourself. Lots of time saved that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caine threw open a door and ushered Caleb into a
room where a dozen or more men were seated about a
long table. Bowing carelessly to the members in general,
Caine took a seat at the table, and motioned Conover
toward a chair that had been placed for the
purpose at the lower end of the apartment. Conover,
disregarding the gesture, slouched across to a larger,
more comfortable leather chair, pulled it to the window,
flung himself into the seat, his back to the strong
afternoon light, and drew out a cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then, gentlemen,&#8221; he ordered curtly, as he
struck a match on his sole. &#8220;Be as brief as you
can. My time&#8217;s worth money. What do you want
of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>A murmur&mdash;almost a stifled gasp&mdash;went around
the table, at the contempt in his action and words.
There was an embarrassed pause. Then, Reuben
Standish, as Chairman of the Committee, rose, gray
and portentous, and turned toward Caleb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Conover,&#8221; he began, &#8220;Certain statements,&mdash;charges,
in fact,&mdash;have been made to the Committee,
relative to yourself. It is your right to hear them in
detail. I will now read&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>&#8220;Never mind that!&#8221; commanded Conover. &#8220;Just
give the gist of the thing. Cut out the details.&#8221;</p>

<p>Standish glared reprovingly at the wholly unimpressed
man at the window. But as the latter purposely
sat with his back to the light, his expression
was quite illegible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as you wish,&#8221; resumed the Chairman after a
moment&#8217;s hesitation. &#8220;The papers I was about to
read are to the effect that you are declared to be in no
sense a desirable member of the Arareek Club, either
from a personal or a business standpoint. Believe
me, I regret the necessity of&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll take your grief for granted,&#8221; interrupted
Conover. &#8220;This meeting&#8217;s been called, as I understand
it, to kick me out of the Arareek. Now I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are mistaken, Mr. Conover,&#8221; urged Standish
civilly. &#8220;We wish&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be quiet!&#8221; said Caleb, &#8220;<i>I&#8217;m</i> talkin&#8217; now. You
want to get me out of this Club. Well, you can&#8217;t do
it. You can&#8217;t stir me an inch. I&#8217;m no measly lamb,
like the one in the circus &#8216;Happy Family&#8217; where the
lion an&#8217; the lamb live together in one cage; an&#8217; where
the lamb&#8217;s got to be renewed ev&#8217;ry now an&#8217; then, on the
sly. I didn&#8217;t butt in here. I was elected. I&#8217;ve broke
none of the Club rules. And till I do, here I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; to stay. Is that clear? There ain&#8217;t a law in the
land that can get me out. Lord! But it makes me
sick to hear a pack of sapheads like you, tryin&#8217; to scare
a grown man. It won&#8217;t work. Now we understand
each other. Anything more?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>Amid the buzz, a man half way down the table
spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that we <i>don&#8217;t</i> quite understand
each other, Mr. Conover. This is not a business
concern. It is a social club. It is a place where the
women of our families are also welcome guests. The
presence of a man we cannot introduce to our wives
and daughters will only&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Why</i> can&#8217;t you?&#8221; demanded Conover. &#8220;Why
can&#8217;t you introduce me? An&#8217; for that matter, I
haven&#8217;t asked you to, yet. Wait till I do, before you
say you can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This club,&#8221; went on the other, &#8220;represents all that
is best and most congenial in Granite&#8217;s social life.
With a discordant element introduced into it, the
club&#8217;s chief feature is gone. If there is a man who
frequents the place whom we do not know and whom
we do not wish to know&mdash;who cannot meet our&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see we&#8217;ll have to waste more time over this than
I thought,&#8221; grunted Caleb. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go back a little.
Why don&#8217;t you want to know me? Hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Need we go into that? Surely&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you have made it one of the reasons for wantin&#8217;
me fired, I guess we&#8217;d better. Why don&#8217;t you want
to know me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you force me to say it, because you are not a
gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; sneered Caleb, as a new and fainter murmur
of deprecation ran along the table, &#8220;Maybe
I&#8217;m not. I don&#8217;t get tanked up on cheap booze down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
in the bar after golf tournaments, like a lot of your
&#8216;gentlemen&#8217; here, an&#8217; then wander up to dinner on
the veranda an&#8217; talk so loud that the women at the
next table can&#8217;t hear themselves cackle. I don&#8217;t ask
a party of men and women to dine with me here an&#8217;
then get a silly jag an&#8217; sing &#8216;<i>Mother, Pin a Rose on
Me</i>,&#8217; every five minutes durin&#8217; the meal till ev&#8217;rybody
at the table gets scared for fear I&#8217;ll sing somethin&#8217;
worse,&mdash;like <i>you</i> did last Sunday night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Conover&#8217;s interlocutor sat down very hard and tried
to look loftily indifferent. Caine&#8217;s undisguised laugh
made the effort more difficult.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; pursued Caleb, with impersonal calm, &#8220;I&#8217;m
not a gentleman. I used to think maybe I&#8217;d like to
be one. But I don&#8217;t, any more. I come down here
for dinner sometimes, Sunday evenin&#8217;. As there&#8217;s
no one exactly clamorin&#8217; to entertain me, I&#8217;ve plenty
of chance to use my eyes an&#8217; ears. So I get a line
on &#8216;gentlemen&#8217; an&#8217; on how they act when they&#8217;re in
their own crowd. At the table next to me last Sunday,
there was a little dinner party. &#8217;Bout a dozen
in all. <i>You</i> was givin&#8217; it, I b&#8217;lieve, Mr. Featherstone.
By the time dessert came everybody was
a-tellin&#8217; stories. Stories <i>I</i> wouldn&#8217;t tell in a barroom.
Women, too. Gee! I never knew before that
women&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Chairman!&#8221; cried Featherstone, jumping up.
&#8220;I protest against this vile abuse. As a member of
the Arareek&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a member of the Arareek,&#8221; cut in Caleb,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
&#8220;you&#8217;ll set down an&#8217; be quiet. You&#8217;ve had your say.
What I&#8217;ve just told, I&#8217;ve told as a member of the
Club&mdash;an&#8217; to fellow-members. Of course if I&#8217;m
kicked out of the Arareek&mdash;an&#8217; kicked out on <i>your</i>
vote, Featherstone&mdash;I won&#8217;t feel bound to keep my
mouth shut about those same stories or who told &#8217;em.
Nor what you whispered to a girl as you passed my
table on your way out. If&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is blackmail!&#8221; shrieked Featherstone, &#8220;I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s anything you like to name it,&#8221; agreed Caleb,
cheerfully, &#8220;But it goes. Understand that. Anyone
else got somethin&#8217; to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to ask Mr. Conover,&#8221; put in another
man, &#8220;if he can truthfully deny that his business dealings
will not bear such inspection as&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As your own deal in buyin&#8217; the tip of where the
new High School was to be built an&#8217; then gettin&#8217; an
option on the land an&#8217; squeezin&#8217; the city for $48,000?&#8221;
asked Conover. &#8220;Oh, I guess most of my business
will frame up pretty well alongside of that. Say,
your talk of &#8216;business methods&#8217; makes me laugh,
when I remember what you offered for that tip an&#8217;
who you went shares with on the money you got.
As a feller Club member, my mouth&#8217;s shut on that.
When I&#8217;m kicked out, it&#8217;ll be a diff&#8217;rent story. That&#8217;s
blackmail again, if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>A nervous, gray-haired man at the foot of the
board checked comment by saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s scarcely needful, Mr. Conover, to adopt that
tone. For the sake of the club&#8217;s good name, we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
simply inquiring into the truth of certain reports of
the way your money was made. We&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my own business how it was made, Mr.
Hawarden,&#8221; countered Caleb. &#8220;The way I spend it
is anybody&#8217;s business. An&#8217; when I leave this Club
I&#8217;m willin&#8217; to make public the accounts of some of my
disbursements.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though the retort was not rough of tone and
seemed quite harmless,&mdash;even vapid&mdash;of meaning,
Hawarden all at once dropped out of the dispute. In
vain did several of his fellow Committeemen who had
relied on him to press the prosecution, signal for a
renewal of attack. Thenceforth, throughout the
session, Hawarden was gloomily mute. But there
were others to carry on the attack he had so unexpectedly
abandoned. Notably a downy little man
who sat at Reuben Standish&#8217;s right.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is said, Mr. Conover,&#8221; observed the new assailant,
with an air of nervous relish, &#8220;that your
father was a convict.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the murmur of deprecation at the bland
brutality of the assault. Caine leaned far forward,
hoping to catch a glimpse of Caleb&#8217;s silhouetted face,
and half expecting to see the downy-haired accusor
tossed bodily from the window.</p>

<p>For an instant, Conover made no reply. His cigar
had gone out and he was busy fumbling for a match.
But when he did speak, it was with perfect, unaffected
calm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Vroom,&#8221; he said, &#8220;My father <i>was</i> a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
convict. He may be one again, by this time, for anything
<i>I</i> know. I&#8217;ve never set eyes on the old crook
since the day they sentenced him to five years in the
pen.&#8221;</p>

<p>He puffed at his cigar. Then rambled on, half to
himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was ten years old then. It was my birthday, I
remember. The old man had a job in the C. G. &amp; X.
coal yards. I came home early from school. Ma had
promised me a birthday cake with candles for supper.
She an&#8217; dad had planned to have some measly little
cel&#8217;bration for me, an&#8217; take me a to variety show in
the evenin&#8217;. I ran home all the way from school.
When I got to the ten&#8217;ment, there was a crowd of
gapin&#8217; kids an&#8217; women around our door. Just then
out came a couple of cops with Dad between &#8217;em; an&#8217;
Ma followed with her apron over her head, cryin&#8217; to
break her heart. I remember she still had one of those
silly birthday candles gripped in her hand. She&#8217;d been
puttin&#8217; it onto the cake when the cops came. After
that there wasn&#8217;t any talk of birthday sprees in the
Conover flat. It was up to us to hustle. An&#8217; we did.
My mother went out washin&#8217; an&#8217; as a floor-scrubber.
An&#8217; <i>I</i> got a job as tally boy in the C. G. &amp; X. yards.
That was my start.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused again, looked thoughtfully at his cigar
ash and went on in a more business-like tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Vroom, my father was a convict. Not
much of one; but as much as his small chances allowed.
He was only weigher at the coal scales. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
&#8216;fixed&#8217; the scales an&#8217; took his rake-off. That was all.
It went on for a couple years. We got the only square
meals I&#8217;d ever ate, durin&#8217; that time. Then he was sent
up; an&#8217;&mdash;well, Ma wasn&#8217;t used to scrubbin&#8217;. She
took pneumonia an&#8217; died the year before Dad got out.
He never came back to our neighborhood, an&#8217; I haven&#8217;t
seen him since. He may be dead or in jail or a mine
owner, for all I know&mdash;or care. I&#8217;m sorry, for the
sake of your arg&#8217;ment, he wasn&#8217;t more of a criminal,
Mr. Vroom. Now, if he&#8217;d been indicted for misappropriation
of the Orphan&#8217;s Home trust funds, like
your wife&#8217;s brother was; an&#8217; if his family had had the
indictment quashed by payin&#8217; the right parties
$18,400&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are out of order, Mr. Conover!&#8221; rebuked
Standish, in answer to a look of frenzied protest from
Vroom. &#8220;Your retort is&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is dead-true; an&#8217; I&#8217;ve the means of layin&#8217; my hands
on the proof,&#8221; finished Caleb. &#8220;I&#8217;d do it, too&mdash;just
for the sake of punishin&#8217; a cur&mdash;if the cur&#8217;s brother-in-law,
Mr. Vroom, didn&#8217;t happen to be a clubmate of
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With a man like this on our rolls,&#8221; fumed an
elderly Governor, &#8220;We shall lose our reputation
for&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If some of you fellers could get rid of your reputations,&#8221;
interrupted Caleb, &#8220;you&#8217;d be in luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>A man at Standish&#8217;s left had risen and was awaiting
a moment of silence in which to speak. He was
nattily clad in blue reefer and white duck trousers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
A yachting cap lay on the table beside him. Every
inch of his stalwart body from the curling black hair
and pink cheeks down to the immaculate white canvas
shoes bespoke a perfection of grooming that seemed
vaguely redolent of scented soap and tailors&#8217; models.
His full red lips were curled back now from a double
set of ultra-pearly teeth, and his eyes, which Desir&eacute;e
Shevlin had disrespectfully likened to twin chocolate
pies, were glassy with wrath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Brother Blacarda,&#8221; hailed Conover, breaking
off in his reply as his gaze rested on this latest
opponent who stood threateningly above him, &#8220;What
have <i>you</i> got to say? Did you come to congratulate
me on the Steeloid win-out, or have you somethin&#8217; to
add to the bokays that your little friends here have
been tossin&#8217; at me? Speak up, man! Stop lookin&#8217;
like &#8216;This-Nobby-Style-$7.49,&#8217; an&#8217; say what you&#8217;ve got
to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve played a trick on my Steeloid Company,&#8221;
sputtered Blacarda, &#8220;that ought to land you in State&#8217;s
Prison with your crook father. A trick that ought
to put you out of the society of decent men. It will
certainly put you out of this Club. Either you leave
the Arareek or I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, that&#8217;s too bad, Blacarda,&#8221; purred
Caleb, &#8220;Us chappies at the Club will be real sorry
to lose you. But if you <i>must</i> go,&mdash;why take my
blessin&#8217; with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This man, gentlemen,&#8221; pursued Blacarda, loudly,
wheeling to face the rest, &#8220;has, by dirty chicanery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
absorbed all the Independent Steeloid Companies,&mdash;my
own among the number,&mdash;in his iniquitous Trust.
Let him deny it if he dares to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Deny it?&#8221; laughed Caleb, &#8220;Not me! Best day&#8217;s
work of my life. Cleaned up an easy million on the
deal. Watcher you goin&#8217; to do about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do about it?&#8221; gasped Blacarda. &#8220;<i>Do</i> about it?
There&#8217;s a law in the land and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; assented Caleb, &#8220;A Fed&#8217;ral law an&#8217; a
law of States, too. It&#8217;s lucky those two laws ain&#8217;t the
same. Otherwise, you&#8217;d have been outlawed from the
whole country instead of only from Iowa, the time
you promoted that fake Des Moines Improvement
Comp&#8217;ny. But that&#8217;s neither here nor there. I&#8217;m told
you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to carry our Steeloid squabble to the
Legislature. I tell you in advance, you&#8217;ll lose. You
may be able to swing part of the Assembly, but I can
do a little swingin&#8217; myself, up there. You&#8217;ll find the
Steeloid Trust is goin&#8217; to win at the Capital as easy
as it won to-day at&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have Right behind us,&#8221; blustered Blacarda,
&#8220;and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; the Steeloid Trust has Caleb Conover behind
it,&#8221; retorted Caleb. &#8220;I guess he&#8217;s as good a backer as
&#8216;Right,&#8217; any day. I&#8217;m expectin&#8217; a tough scramble in
order to beat you at the Capital, Blacarda. But I&#8217;ll
do it. I&#8217;ll be on the ground myself. An&#8217; I&#8217;ll beat
you as sure as I beat you to-day. It&#8217;ll mean a fight&mdash;a
big fight. I know that. But a fight&#8217;s somethin&#8217; I
don&#8217;t generally run ki-yi-in&#8217; away from.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>&#8220;All this is somewhat beside the point, gentlemen,&#8221;
interposed Standish. &#8220;Is there any further&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and glanced about the table. But no one
cared to couch lance at the brute who had thus far
held the lists so successfully against the Arareek&#8217;s
doughtiest champions. At length Caine spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;It appears to me,&#8221; he drawled in his lazy, half-bantering
way, &#8220;that these proceedings have been decidedly
informal; even for an avowedly informal
meeting. Also, that we have made little real progress
on either side. There are several broken heads, and
the atmosphere is somewhat heavy with the reek of
battle. But I fail to hear any shout of victory. Certainly
not from our Honorable Committee. Perhaps
you will all pardon me if I suggest that our learned
body has gone about the present business in a less
tactful way that one might have expected from such
natural diplomats. Mr. Conover, you have had to
answer some extremely impertinent&mdash;<i>unnecessarily</i>
impertinent&mdash;questions this afternoon. If you have
answered them in their own key, I am sure no one can
honestly blame you. Unless you care to say anything
more, I think the Committee may as well go at once
into executive session and put the matter to vote. I
so move, Mr. Chairman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on a second,&#8221; said Conover. &#8220;You people
can vote in a minute if you want to. First, <i>I&#8217;ve</i> got
a word more to say. The main counts against me,
as I take it, are that I had a bad start in life an&#8217; that
my business methods aren&#8217;t any better than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
methods of other men in this Club. Also that I ain&#8217;t
a gentleman. We&#8217;ll let the question of my business
methods slide. I guess there ain&#8217;t as few stones on
the carpet as there&#8217;s men here to throw &#8217;em at me
on <i>that</i> score. Now, as to my not bein&#8217; a gentleman
an&#8217; my start in life: I started at the bottom of the
ladder. I&#8217;m only in the early thirties and I&#8217;m not far
from the top. How many of you could a&#8217; got where
I am if you&#8217;d started where I did? Not a man of
you. I worked my way up from tally boy of the C.
G. &amp; X. yards to the job of president of the whole
road. An&#8217; I&#8217;m makin&#8217; it the biggest road in the State.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d I do it? By fightin&#8217;. I had no pull, no
cash, no family at my back. Ev&#8217;rybody took a turn
at tryin&#8217; to step on my hands whenever I&#8217;d grab a
new rung of the ladder. But I climbed on&mdash;an&#8217; I
fought on. To-day I&#8217;m as rich a man as there is in
Granite. Other rich men were members of this Club
an&#8217; got fun out of it. So I joined it, too. I&#8217;ve as
good a right to fun as anyone. An&#8217; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to have
it. That&#8217;s why I won&#8217;t get out. An&#8217; you can&#8217;t put
me out. You&#8217;re goin&#8217; to vote on my case in a few
minutes. An&#8217; you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to vote to keep me here.
Not because you want to; but because I&#8217;ve <i>made</i> you
do it. If you hit a sulky dog with an axe-handle, he
won&#8217;t exactly love you. But he&#8217;ll mind you, next
time. An&#8217; it&#8217;s better to be minded than to be ignored.
I guess there won&#8217;t anybody here ignore me in future.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, gentlemen: Just to show how much
int&#8217;rested I am in the Club&#8217;s welfare, I bought in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
mortgage on the Arareek&#8217;s house and grounds last
month. I bought it for fear it might fall in the hands
of some crank member who&#8217;d foreclose if he was
dropped from the Club. Or such a crank as might
foreclose if he was treated like a measly social leper
at the Club&#8217;s blowouts. That&#8217;s all, gentlemen. I&#8217;ll
wait out on the porch for your verdict. Good-day,
all. I&#8217;ll excuse the Committee from risin&#8217; and escortin&#8217;
me to the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose, stretched his big frame and lounged out
of the room. Silence accompanied his exit, but was
split by a dozen excited voices the moment the door
slammed behind him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Caleb Conover was loafing in a low wicker chair on
the veranda, a cigar between his teeth and a long
frosty glass at his side. He was idly watching the
putting match on the green before him. The veranda&#8217;s
other occupants had more or less unobtrusively
withdrawn to the far end of the porch, leaving him
quite alone.</p>

<p>It was thus Caine found him when the Committee
meeting broke up. The newspaper owner strolled
across toward Conover, a tantalizing smile on his thin,
bored face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he queried.</p>

<p>Conover glanced up eagerly at his friend&#8217;s approach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Caine,&#8221; he asked, pointing, &#8220;Why do they
choose one of the iron-tipped sticks sometimes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
then use one of the brass headed ones next time, for
just the same kind of a swat?&#8221;</p>

<p>Caine gazed down at Caleb in genuine wonder; then
dropped into a chair at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Conover,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;You&#8217;re the only man on
earth who never bores me. And it&#8217;s because you
never by any chance happen to say or do what people
have a right to expect you to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s a riddle&mdash;&#8221; said Caleb, puzzled, as he
looked away from the green.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s genius,&#8221; answered Caine. &#8220;Here
I come to bring you the decision of the Committee.
The decision that&#8217;s supposedly been keeping you on
pins and needles. And, instead of dragging the news
out of me by main force, you ask a question about a
putting match.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the decision?&#8221; returned Caleb, carelessly.
&#8220;That&#8217;s all right. I&#8217;m to be kept on as a pop&#8217;lar,
respected member. I knew that before I left the
Committee room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew more than I did, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I always do,&#8221; agreed Caleb with utter simplicity.
&#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m where I am to-day. If I couldn&#8217;t
size up folk&#8217;s plans before they made &#8217;em, I&#8217;d still be
a brakeman on the C. G. &amp; X. or runnin&#8217; the railroad
saloon where I made my first cash. I&#8217;m kept in the
Club by every vote except Blacarda&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You listened?&#8221; cried Caine in wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Son,&#8221; sighed Caleb, wearily, &#8220;You make me tired.
Why should I a-listened when I knew already?&#8221;</p>

<small>CALEB CONOVER EXPLAINS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; volunteered Caine, as he and Conover
walked back to town together, &#8220;I suppose you know
you behaved like a wild ass of the desert? That no
man with an iota of breeding would ever have said the
things you did, to the Committee members? I only
mention it in case you don&#8217;t realize.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I realize it all right,&#8221; Conover answered him.
&#8220;It ain&#8217;t a parlor stunt to sling off your coat an&#8217; grab
a lady by the back hair. But if she happens to be
drownin&#8217;, it&#8217;s the c&#8217;rrect play to make. It was a case
for coat-sheddin&#8217; an&#8217; back-hair-grabbin&#8217;, to-day, at the
Club. That&#8217;s why I did it. It landed &#8217;em. If I&#8217;d
got up and sprung a flowery speech, they&#8217;d a&#8217; yawned
and voted me out. If I&#8217;d put up a whine, they&#8217;d
a&#8217; been at my throat like a pack o&#8217; hungry wolf-dogs.
<i>Someone</i> had to use a whip. An&#8217; I wanted it should
be <i>me</i>, not them, that used it. Which same it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one will deny that, I think,&#8221; said Caine, drily,
&#8220;If a poll were taken just now for the best hated man
in Arareek, you&#8217;d be elected by acclamation. You
said some things that ought to have been said. But
you said them so vulgarly that you seemed to be spitting
diamonds.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>&#8220;But I&#8217;m still in the Club. An&#8217; they daren&#8217;t give
me the cold shoulder at any more of their blowouts.
They&#8217;ll still hate me like poison, maybe. But they&#8217;ll
be civil; an&#8217; when Desir&eacute;e Shevlin goes there with
Mrs. Hawarden, she won&#8217;t see folks treatin&#8217; me like
I was the original Invisible Man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caine whistled.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>So?</i>&#8221; he mused. &#8220;That&#8217;s the secret is it? I
might have guessed. I&#8217;ve been wondering ever since,
why you made such a point about being well received
at the Club&#8217;s functions. For, unless I&#8217;m vastly mistaken,
you&#8217;ve about as much desire for personal social
welcome as a hermit thrush. I could see why you
wanted to <i>stay</i> in the Arareek, but why you wanted
to attend its&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re barkin&#8217; up the wrong tree,&#8221; growled Caleb,
uncomfortably. &#8220;At least you ain&#8217;t much more&#8217;n
half right. Of course it&#8217;s nice not to have Dey made
uncomfortable on my account. But I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to push
my way into that bunch for my own sake, too. You&#8217;ll
see a whole lot of things if you look long enough.
To-day was just a flea-bite to what&#8217;s comin&#8217; before
I&#8217;m done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still bent on &#8216;taking the Kingdom of Heaven by
violence?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not quite that. I hear Heaven&#8217;s got only the <i>best</i>
society. I ain&#8217;t after the best. Only the highest.
So Granite&#8217;ll do as well. Care to tell me anything
&#8217;bout the details of what happened after I left the
Committee room?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>&#8220;Everybody talked at once,&#8221; replied Caine. &#8220;The
air fairly crackled with blue sparks of indignation. I
never realized before how many names a man could be
called. It was a liberal education in what not to say.
Then, little by little, the Governors got out of breath,
and I moved for a vote. Vroom amended my motion
by suggesting a written ballot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I might a&#8217; knowed it,&#8221; crowed Conover in high
glee, &#8220;No one wanted the rest to know he was votin&#8217;
for me. Good for Vroom! He comes nearer havin&#8217;
hooman intell&#8217;gence than I thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The amended motion was passed unanimously,&#8221;
went on Caine. &#8220;Oh, it was a rare study in physiognomy
when Standish announced the vote. Eleven
to one in favor of retaining you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;d been two votes against me, Blacarda
could have been arrested for repeatin&#8217;,&#8221; ruminated
Conover. &#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s just how I figgered it would
be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t surprised at Vroom and Featherstone
and the others you so pleasantly threatened to blackmail,&#8221;
said Caine, &#8220;But I thought at least Standish
and Hawarden&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you I&#8217;d helped Standish&#8217;s bank and that
he&#8217;ll want me again, soon,&#8221; answered Caleb. &#8220;His
gratitood market is strong on futurities.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Hawarden? You didn&#8217;t threaten him. Yet
he was muzzled after the very first attack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t threaten Hawarden to any very great
extent,&#8221; assented Conover, &#8220;I just reminded him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
quiet-like, that I&#8217;m payin&#8217; his wife $8,000 a season to
help Desir&eacute;e in the society game, an&#8217; that maybe the
news might leak out an&#8217; the supplies be cut off if I was
fired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Hawarden!&#8221; ejaculated Caine. &#8220;Are you
in earnest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not given to springin&#8217; measly jokes. I
wanted that the little girl should have a show. She&#8217;s
prettier an&#8217; better educated an&#8217; cleverer&#8217;n any of the
people in the gold-shirt bunch. But I couldn&#8217;t get
her into that crowd. I read in a noospaper about
an English duchess that made a lot of coin by puttin&#8217;
American girls into the right surroundin&#8217;s, an&#8217; it gave
me an idee. There&#8217;s a slump in the Duchess market
here at Granite. But the town&#8217;s crawlin&#8217; with old
fam&#8217;lies that are shy on cash. An&#8217; about the oldest
an&#8217; hardest up are the Hawardens. So I arranged it
with her. It was dead easy. She acted shy of the
deal just at first; but that was only her way, I s&#8217;pose.
Women that&#8217;s coy after they stop bein&#8217; young an&#8217;
pretty always reminds me of a scarecrow left standin&#8217;
in a field after all the crop&#8217;s been carted away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Miss Shevlin know about&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does <i>she</i> know? What do you think she is?
No, son, she don&#8217;t know, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll break the neck of the
blackguard that dares tell her. You&#8217;re the only one
except the Hawardens that&#8217;s onto it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I am the logical candidate for neck-breaking
if the story gets out? Don&#8217;t be afraid, old man. I&#8217;d
break my own neck sooner than to have Miss Shevlin&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
pleasure spoiled. I suppose she <i>does</i> get pleasure
from being a proteg&eacute;e of Mrs. Hawarden?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pleasure? She&#8217;s tickled to death. It&#8217;s worth
the money twice over to hear her tell &#8217;bout the places
she goes. Say, Caine, <i>you</i> know more about that
game than I do. Has she got any chance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any chance?&#8221; echoed Caine in perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what I mean. Her father was kind
of common,&mdash;like me. But Desir&eacute;e ain&#8217;t. Even
<i>you</i> said that once. An&#8217; I guess there&#8217;s few who can
spot a streak of mud-color quicker&#8217;n you can. I&#8217;ve
got her into a crowd where her father an&#8217; the rest of
her folks could never have gone. What I want to
know is: Has she got a chance of stayin&#8217; there always?
Of bein&#8217; took up permanent by &#8217;em an&#8217; made
one of &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It depends entirely, I should say, on whom she
marries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean if she marries some feller who&#8217;s high
up in that set, she&#8217;ll be made to home there?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something wistfully eager beneath the
Fighter&#8217;s gruff tones,&mdash;a something Caine detected in
time to check the flippant reply that had risen to his
own lips. He eyed Conover with veiled curiosity as
he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;You would want her to marry such a man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure! If he treated her right an&#8217; she was happy.
But if she&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be looked down on, an&#8217; guyed
behind folk&#8217;s fans, an&#8217; reminded that her old man used
to eat corned beef and cabbage in his shirt-sleeves&mdash;why,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
then I&#8217;m damned if I don&#8217;t b&#8217;lieve I&#8217;d buy up
the whole of Granite an&#8217; turn the swells out into the
next County.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It all depends, as I said, on the man she marries,&#8221;
pursued Caine. &#8220;If she marries a man of good family
and turns her back on her old associates and has
enough money of her own&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll have it,&#8221; interrupted Conover. &#8220;She&#8217;ll
have enough to make her the richest woman in this
burg,&mdash;an&#8217; it&#8217;ll be in her own name, too. As for
shakin&#8217; folks like me,&mdash;if I haven&#8217;t got my own foot
hold there by that time,&mdash;she&#8217;ll do that too. I&#8217;ll see
that she does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet you&#8217;re fond of her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m doin&#8217; it, son. An&#8217; remember
you&#8217;ll keep on bein&#8217; the only one besides the Hawardens
that knows anything &#8217;bout my share in the deal.
Speakin&#8217; of &#8216;deals,&#8217; Blacarda means trouble for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the Steeloid affair?&#8221; queried Caine. &#8220;I
thought you&#8217;d won that fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won that, but there&#8217;s another a-comin&#8217;. I got
a tip on it same time I heard of the incorp&#8217;ration,
to-day. Blacarda pulls a pretty big oar in the Legislature.
He&#8217;s back of that Starke Anti-Combine bill
we side-tracked early in the session. If the Starke
bill passes, then goodbye to our Steeloid corner!
I&#8217;ve a tip he&#8217;s renewed it an&#8217; tryin&#8217; to rush it through
before the session closes. It&#8217;s to be sprung on the
Assembly, Monday. An&#8217; he figgers on gettin&#8217; it railroaded
through. If it once passes the Assembly, we&#8217;re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
goners. For he&#8217;s got the State Senate where he wants
it. An&#8217; the Gov&#8217;nor&#8217;s on his side. Owns a nice block
of stock in Blacarda&#8217;s comp&#8217;ny. So it all hangs on
the Assembly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You take it coolly&mdash;considering you stand to
lose something like a million dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man who can&#8217;t keep his feet warm an&#8217; his head
cool has about as much show in finance as a tallow dog
chasin&#8217; an asbestos cat through hell,&#8221; observed Caleb,
oracularly. &#8220;He goes up with a puff and there ain&#8217;t
any remains to look for. I&#8217;m not in the Steeloid deal
to cure me of weak heart or that tired feelin&#8217;. I&#8217;m in
to win. An&#8217; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the Assembly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid about the Assembly. So long as
I&#8217;m on hand myself, in the lobby, to hand out kicks
or kisses, I&#8217;ll be able to kill the Starke bill. I&#8217;ve gone
up to the Capital before, on what looked like a losin&#8217;
fight. An&#8217; I&#8217;ve licked the obstinate one into shape, an&#8217;
scared some backbone into the weak one, an&#8217; put a
little bank-note oil on the rusty ones&mdash;an&#8217; swung
enough of &#8217;em into line to give me the votes I needed.
I know this Assembly pretty well. I know who to
count on an&#8217; who not to. I know who to buy, who
to bully an&#8217; who to promise. If I sent up anyone
else, he&#8217;d make a fizzle of the thing. But, somehow,
in all my business deals, I find if I&#8217;m on the ground
myself I can make folks do what I want. You saw
how that was, to-day, at the Club. If I&#8217;d been away,
an&#8217; you or anyone else representin&#8217; me, I&#8217;d a&#8217; been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
kicked out of the Arareek so far that I&#8217;d a-landed in
another State. But I swung &#8217;em. An&#8217; I&#8217;ll swing
&#8217;em at the Capital. It&#8217;ll be a narrow squeak, but I&#8217;ll
do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In other words, if you are there in person, the
day the bill comes up, you can kill it. Otherwise
not. Suppose you&#8217;re sick, or&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sick!&#8221; scoffed Caleb, in lofty scorn. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
no time to be sick. An&#8217; s&#8217;pose I was? When I
worked that merger of the Porter-Hyde Park road, I
had grippe. My temp&#8217;ture was up at 105, an&#8217; I had
lovely little icicles an&#8217; red hot pokers runnin&#8217; through
every joint of me. Likewise a head that ached so
loud you could hear it a block away. Gee, but I felt
so bad I hated to look up at the undertaker signs on
the street! An&#8217; what&#8217;d I do? Worked, up to the Capital,
three days an&#8217; nights, twenty-four hours a day,
not once gettin&#8217; a chance to take my clo&#8217;es off or bat
an eye. I carried through that merger by the skin
of its teeth. Then when I got my charter I blew
myself to the lux&#8217;ry of a whole gorgeous week in the
hosp&#8217;tal. But not till ev&#8217;ry bit of work was wound
up. Sick? H&#8217;m! A grown man don&#8217;t bother much
about bein&#8217; sick when there&#8217;s something that&#8217;s got to
be done. Besides&#8221;&mdash;he added&mdash;&#8220;I ain&#8217;t sick now.
An&#8217; I&#8217;ll be on hand at the Capital the minute the Assembly
opens, Monday. My bein&#8217; there means the
killin&#8217; of the Starke bill. An&#8217; they can set the date
for the fun&#8217;ral without any fear of disappointin&#8217; the
mourners.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>&#8220;Did you ever hear of Napoleon?&#8221; asked Caine,
whimsically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure I did,&#8221; responded Conover. &#8220;Read part of
a book about him once. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like yourself he was the greatest hold-up man of
his day,&#8221; explained Caine, &#8220;and he had a conscience
of the same calibre as yours. If he&#8217;d been a little bit
less of a highwayman they would have laughed at him.
If <i>you</i> were a little bit less of a highwayman
they&#8217;d put you in jail. He had magnetism. Probably
almost as much of it as you have. That&#8217;s what
made me think of him just then. Wellington used to
say that Napoleon&#8217;s mere presence on a battlefield
did more to win victories than an army of forty-thousand
men. I suppose it&#8217;s the same at the Assembly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; agreed Caleb, unmoved. &#8220;An&#8217;
Blacarda knows it, too. He&#8217;d give ten thousand dollars.
I&#8217;ll bet, to have me break a leg between this an&#8217;
Monday. But my legs are feelin&#8217; first rate. An&#8217;
they&#8217;re goin&#8217; to keep on feelin&#8217; better all the time, till
they kick the Starke bill into its grave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do what I can through the &#8216;<i>Star</i>&#8217; to help,&#8221;
said Caine. &#8220;Just as I did for the Porter-Hyde Park
merger and the Humason Mine charter. What&#8217;s the
use of owning a newspaper if one can&#8217;t boost one&#8217;s
friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; one&#8217;s own Steeloid stock at the same time?&#8221;
supplemented Conover. &#8220;We understand each other
all right, I guess. Steeloid&#8217;s goin&#8217; to take a rise, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
Monday. An&#8217; it&#8217;s goin&#8217; to keep right on risin&#8217; for the
next six months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Conover,&#8221; protested Caine, &#8220;as a highwayman&mdash;or
financier, to put it more politely&mdash;you are a
genius. But as a <i>man</i>, you leave a ghastly amount to
be desired. Have you a superstitious fear of the word
&#8216;Thanks&#8217;? I offer to put the columns of the &#8216;<i>Star</i>&#8217;
at your disposal. Common decency at least should
call for a word of gratitude. Or, if not for the Steeloid
matter, at least for my championing you to-day at
the Club. Surely <i>that</i> wasn&#8217;t in the interest of your
wonderful Steeloid stock.&#8221;</p>

<p>Conover plodded ahead glumly for some moments.
Then he observed, as though turning to a pleasanter
subject:</p>

<p>&#8220;In the part of that Napoleon book I read it told
how the old-line, patent-leather &#8217;ristocrats of France
fell over each other to do things that would make a
hit with the big &#8216;hold-up man&#8217;. Wasn&#8217;t it real
gen&#8217;rous of &#8217;em? But then, maybe Napoleon had a
cute little way of sayin&#8217; &#8216;Thanks,&#8217; oftener&#8217;n <i>I</i> do.&#8221;</p>

<small>AN INTERLUDE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Why folks should drink tea when they&#8217;re not
thirsty, an&#8217; gobble sweet crackers when they&#8217;re not
hungry,&#8221; observed Conover, impersonally, as he balanced
his cup and saucer on one thick palm and stared
at the tea as though it might turn and rend him, &#8220;is
somethin&#8217; I never could make out. As far as I can
learn, s&#8217;ciety is made up of doin&#8217; things you don&#8217;t want
to at times you don&#8217;t need to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing in afternoon tea,&#8221; quoted Desir&eacute;e,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;To appeal to a person like me.</div>
<div class="verse">There&#8217;s too little to eat,</div>
<div class="verse">What there is is too sweet.</div>
<div class="verse">And I feel like a cow up a tree.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; improvised Caine,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;In Boston we threw away tea</div>
<div class="verse">Because of King George&#8217;s decree.</div>
<div class="verse">When England disputed,</div>
<div class="verse">We just revoluted.</div>
<div class="verse">Hurray for the Land of the Free!</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>&#8220;And now that we&#8217;ve all testified,&#8221; he added, &#8220;may
I please have another cup? If not, I&#8217;m going to keep
on repeating insipid verses till I get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men had dropped in at the Shevlin house
on their way from the Arareek Club. Desir&eacute;e had listened
delightedly to Caleb&#8217;s expurgated account of the
Committee meeting, and at the story&#8217;s close had rung
for tea. Caine was a prime favorite of hers. Caleb
was wont to lean back and listen in unaffected admiration
to their talk&mdash;about one-half of which he could
understand. His hazarded remark about tea had been
thus far the Fighter&#8217;s only contribution to the chatter.
Emboldened by it he now ventured a second observation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see by the &#8216;<i>Star</i>&#8217;,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that there&#8217;s goin&#8217;
to be a blowout up at the Standishes&#8217;, week after next.
A dinner party and a musicle. Whatever a musicle
may be. You&#8217;re goin&#8217; of course, Caine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Caine, adding flippantly, &#8220;of course
<i>you</i> are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Caleb, slowly, &#8220;I think I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not in earnest?&#8221; cried Desir&eacute;e, surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in earnest all right. It&#8217;ll be a big affair. I
think I&#8217;ll go to the musicle an&#8217; the dinner too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t know you knew any of the Standishes
except&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t yet. But I will by then. I&#8217;ll get asked.
You&#8217;re goin&#8217; to the musicle part of it with Mrs. Hawarden,
ain&#8217;t you, Dey? You said somethin&#8217; about it
yesterday. Well, you&#8217;ll see me there. Say!&#8221; as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
new idea struck him, &#8220;how&#8217;d you like to be asked to
the dinner, too? That&#8217;s the excloosive part of the
whole show. Only about a dozen guests. More&#8217;n a
couple of hundred at the musicle. Want to go to the
dinner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;What a crazy
idea! As if you could get me an invitation, even if I
<i>did</i> want to!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I could get it all right,&#8221; urged Caleb. &#8220;I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caine, who had dropped wholly out of the talk, rose
to go. There was a curious restraint about his manner
as he bade Desir&eacute;e goodbye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, <i>Caleb Conover</i>!&#8221; rebuked Desir&eacute;e as soon
as she and the Fighter were left alone. &#8220;Of all the
historically idiotic plunges into other peoples&#8217; greenhouses
I <i>ever</i> saw!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ve I done now?&#8221; asked Caleb in due humility.</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>haven&#8217;t</i> you done?&#8221; she retorted. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you know Mr. Caine is engaged to Letty Standish?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d forgotten for the minute. What of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There you sat and boasted you&#8217;d be invited to
dinner at her house! When you don&#8217;t even know
her. What <i>am</i> I to do with you? I&#8217;ve a great mind
to make you drink two more cups of tea!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see yet what the row is,&#8221; he pleaded.
&#8220;But I&#8217;ve riled you, Dey. I&#8217;m awful sorry. I
oughtn&#8217;t to come here when there&#8217;s civilized folks
callin&#8217;. I only make you ashamed, an&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>&#8220;How often must I tell you,&#8221; she cried angrily, her
big eyes suddenly growing moist, &#8220;never to say such
things? You know they hurt me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should it hurt anyone when I talk of goin&#8217;
to a&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not speaking about the dinner. It&#8217;s about
your not coming to see me. If people don&#8217;t like to
meet my chum, they needn&#8217;t call on me. As for being
&#8216;ashamed&#8217; of <i>you</i>&mdash;here! Take this cup of tea
and drink it. <i>Drink</i> it, I say. And when you finish
you must drink another. <i>All</i> of it. With sugar in
it. Two lumps. I don&#8217;t care if you do hate sweet
things. You&#8217;ve got to be punished! Drink it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Conover obediently gulped down the loathed liquid
and held out his cup with an air of awkward contrition,
for the second instalment of his penance.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Now</i>, do I get forgiven?&#8221; he begged. &#8220;It&#8217;s vile
stuff. An&#8217; I drank every drop, Dey. Please be
friends again. Aw, <i>please</i> do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You big overgrown baby!&#8221; she said looking
laughingly down into his red, remorseful face. &#8220;You
talk very, <i>very</i> loudly about being a &#8216;grown man&#8217;,
and a financier. And some of the papers call you
&#8216;Brute&#8217; Conover&mdash;the wretched sheets! But you&#8217;re
only about ten years old. No one knows you except
me. To the others you may be able to talk as if you
were grown up, but it never imposes on <i>me</i> for a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; he assented wonderingly. &#8220;I
never thought of it that way before. I don&#8217;t know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
why it is except maybe because I never had any boyhood
or had a chance to be young. I seem to have
been born grown up an&#8217; on the lookout to get the best
of the next feller. Then, when I get with you, I lose
about twenty years and feel like a kid. It&#8217;s great to
be that way. Nobody else ever makes me feel so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose not,&#8221; mocked the girl. &#8220;Your other
friends are fossly people all about a million years old.
And you look on me as a child and try to talk and act
down to my level. It is <i>very</i> humiliating. I&#8217;m nearly
twenty and quite grown up and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your eyes are, anyhow,&#8221; commented Caleb.
&#8220;They&#8217;re two sizes too large for your face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that a compliment? If it is&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; pursued Conover. &#8220;I never noticed
how big they was till one day when you were
drinkin&#8217; ice-tea. Then, all of a sudden, it struck me
that if your eyes wasn&#8217;t so big you&#8217;d be li&#8217;ble to tumble
into your glass. Now you&#8217;re mad again!&#8221; he sighed.
&#8220;But it&#8217;s true. You&#8217;re awful little. You don&#8217;t much
more&#8217;n come up to my elbow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re <i>quite</i> through saying woozzey
things about my size and my eyes,&#8221; said Desir&eacute;e,
coldly, &#8220;perhaps you won&#8217;t mind talking of something
sensible?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d just as leave,&#8221; hesitated Caleb, &#8220;I&#8217;d like
to talk a little &#8217;bout what you said a few minutes ago.
About my bein&#8217; young. You don&#8217;t get it quite right.
I&#8217;m not young an&#8217; I never was or will be,&mdash;except
with you. When you an&#8217; me are together, some part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
of me that I don&#8217;t gener&#8217;lly know is there, seems to
take charge. Maybe I don&#8217;t explain it very clear. I
don&#8217;t seem quite to understand it myself. Here&#8217;s the
idee: D&#8217;you remember that measly little green-covered
French book I found you cryin&#8217; over, once? The
&#8216;Vee&#8217; of something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean Barriere&#8217;s &#8216;<i>Vie de Boh&eacute;me</i>?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. The French play you said was wrote
from a book by some other parly-voo chap. You told
me the story of it, I remember. It didn&#8217;t make much
of a hit with me at the time, an&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t quite see
where the cry come in. But I got to thinkin&#8217; of it
when you spoke just now. Remember the chap in
there who told the girl she was his Youth an&#8217; that if
it wasn&#8217;t for her he&#8217;d be nothin&#8217; but just a plain grown
man? &#8217;Twas <i>her</i> that kep&#8217; him feelin&#8217; like a boy.
An&#8217; then when she died&mdash;let&#8217;s see&mdash;what was it he
hollered? Something &#8217;bout&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>O, ma Jeunesse, c&#8217;est vous qu&#8217;on enterre</i>,&#8217;&#8221;
quoted Desir&eacute;e.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe so,&#8221; assented Caleb, doubtfully. &#8220;It
sounds like a Chinee laundry ticket to <i>me</i>. That was
the part you were cryin&#8217; over, too. What is it in English?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh my <i>Youth</i>, it is <i>you</i> they are burying!&#8217;&#8221;
translated the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the answer,&#8221; said Conover, gravely.
&#8220;Now let&#8217;s talk about something better worth while
than me. I was chinnin&#8217; with Caine this afternoon
about you. He says if you marry the right sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
man, your place in society&#8217;s cinched. What do you
think of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How utterly silly!&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;Caleb, this
society idea of yours has become an obsession. What
do I care for that sort of thing? It&#8217;s pleasant to be
asked to houses where one has a good time. That&#8217;s
all. It&#8217;s like eating ice-cream when one is used to
bread pudding. I&#8217;m not anxious to eat, drink and
breathe nothing but ice-cream three times a day all the
rest of my life. Why should I want a &#8216;cinched place
in society&#8217; as you so elegantly put it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; he insisted. &#8220;It means
a lot more&#8217;n that. With your looks and brains an&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217;
the big lot of cash your father left you,&mdash;you
could make no end of a hit there. You&#8217;d run the
whole works inside of five years. You&#8217;d have the
same sort of position here in Granite that Mrs. Astor
an&#8217; those people have in New York. Think of that,
Dey! It&#8217;s a thing you can&#8217;t afford to throw away.
When anyone says he don&#8217;t care to shine in s&#8217;ciety,&mdash;well,
you may not tell him so; but you think it, all the
same. An&#8217; it&#8217;d be a crime for <i>you</i> to miss it all. If
you marry the right sort of man&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The right sort of man!&#8217;&#8221; mimicked Desir&eacute;e,
wrathfully, &#8220;Caleb, there are times when I&#8217;d like to
box your ears. I wish you and Mr. Caine would mind
your own grubby Steeloid business and not gabble like
two old washerwomen about my affairs. &#8216;The right
sort of a man&mdash;!&#8217; Why,&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you like to marry Amzi Nicholas Caine?&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
suggested Conover, tentatively. &#8220;Dandy fam&#8217;ly,&mdash;fairly
rich&mdash;good looker&mdash;travels in the best
crowd&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Warranted sound and kind&mdash;a child can drive
him&mdash;a good hill climber&mdash;guaranteed rustless,&#8221;
snapped Desir&eacute;e in lofty contempt. &#8220;Caleb, do you
<i>want</i> to be made to drink more tea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Honest, girl, I&#8217;m in earnest. He&#8217;s&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s engaged to Letty Standish, for one thing.
And if he wasn&#8217;t, I wouldn&#8217;t marry him if he and a
tone-deaf piano tuner were the only two men left on
earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His bein&#8217; engaged to the Standish girl needn&#8217;t
matter,&#8221; urged Caleb, too much engrossed in her first
observation to note the second, &#8220;Because I can fix
that all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of her indignation, Desir&eacute;e laughed aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you great and wise man!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;How,
may I ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know yet,&#8221; he said with perfect confidence,
&#8220;Because I haven&#8217;t thought it over. But I can fix it.
I can always fix things when I have to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, in this case,&#8221; she retorted, &#8220;you can spare
yourself the crime of parting two loving souls and
fracturing two adoring hearts and shattering Granite&#8217;s
social fabric just on my account. When I really want
to marry and I find I can&#8217;t lure the shrinking Adonis
to my feet I&#8217;ll let you know. Then you can try your
luck at making him propose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, I will,&#8221; promised Conover, in all seriousness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
&#8220;Just give me the word when the time comes an&#8217; the
feller&#8217;s yours for the askin&#8217;. But I&#8217;m kind of disappointed
in the way you turn Caine down. It seemed
such a grand idee. That&#8217;s one of the reasons I asked
him in, this afternoon. I thought when you saw us
together he&#8217;d kind of shine by contrast with me, you
know. More&#8217;n when you meet him with folks of his
own sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The contrast was there!&#8221; she blazed. &#8220;It fairly
<i>sizzled</i>, it was so strong. For one thing Mr. Caine
has manner. And you haven&#8217;t got even <i>manners</i>.
And I ought to hate you for daring to talk so to me.
And&mdash;and you&#8217;re the dearest, stupidest, splendidest
boy I know. Now I&#8217;m going to dress for dinner.
You can talk to Siegfried-Mickey if you want to while
I&#8217;m gone. But if you want to win his fondness, don&#8217;t
make silly, squiffy plans for his social future.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was out of the room before Conover could
frame an answer. But on the instant she had turned
back long enough to thrust her flushed face momentarily
through the opening of the curtains and suggest
demurely:</p>

<p>&#8220;Caleb, if Mr. Hawarden should ever die, don&#8217;t
you think it would be nice for Mrs. Hawarden to
marry Billy? It would make the dear little fellow&#8217;s
position in society so nice and secure!&#8221;</p>

<small>CALEB CONOVER RUNS AWAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The following Monday morning found Caleb at
the Capital ready and waiting for the battle which
lay before him. He had arrived from Granite late
Sunday night; with Caine and with one or two personal
followers on whose timely aid, he knew from
experience, he might count.</p>

<p>For two days there had been a ceaseless downpour
of rain. Conover and Caine, draped in long waterproof
coats, stood at the entrance of their hotel, looking
out on the flooded streets and dingy, streaming
sky. They were waiting for the carriage that was to
bear them to the State House. Caine glanced ever at
his watch, his armor of habitual bored indifference
worn perilously thin. Conover, on the other hand,
showed no more emotion than if he were on his way
to luncheon. As Caine&#8217;s hand, for the tenth time,
crept toward his watch pocket, the Fighter remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can save you the trouble of lookin&#8217;, son, by tellin&#8217;
you the startlin&#8217; news that it&#8217;s just about thirty seconds
later&#8217;n it was when you took out your watch
before. What&#8217;s your worry? We&#8217;re in lots of time.
As long as we get there when the Assembly&#8217;s called to
order it&#8217;s all we care. I&#8217;ve done ev&#8217;rything that <i>can</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
be done. All I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to the lobby for is to jack
those able statesmen up when Blacarda starts to stampede
&#8217;em. I&#8217;ve made my arrangements with each man
who&#8217;s goin&#8217; to vote our way. An&#8217;, as I figger out,
we&#8217;ll kill that Starke bill by two votes. Easy that
many. But there&#8217;s four or five Assemblymen that
need my fatherly eye on &#8217;em when the bill comes up.
Otherwise they&#8217;ll sure bolt. I know &#8217;em. While I&#8217;m
there I&#8217;m like your friend Napoleon; worth 40,000
men. Or, 40,000 dollars, if you like it better that
way. I&#8217;ve got my grip on the reins. Don&#8217;t you
fret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard something just now,&#8221; said Caine.
&#8220;Something that it will surprise you to learn. I had
it from the &#8216;<i>Star&#8217;s</i>&#8217; Legislature correspondent. It
seems Blacarda tried to prevent your coming to the
Capital at all. I&#8217;m rather surprised at his playing
such a trick. But I suppose it goes to prove that a
man is known by the company he promotes. He
heard you were due from Granite on the 5.30 train this
morning. And he paid the engineer $600 to have the
locomotive break down thirty miles from here. You
would have been stalled there until too late to be of
any use. The Assembly would have met and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; stampeded,&#8221; finished Caleb stolidly. &#8220;An&#8217;
the Starke bill would&#8217;ve gone through an&#8217; we&#8217;d a&#8217; been
licked. Quite so. That&#8217;s why I changed my plans,
the last minute, an&#8217; came here last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew of Blacarda&#8217;s move?&#8221; cried Caine in
amazement.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>&#8220;Son,&#8221; yawned Conover, &#8220;it&#8217;s my business to
know things. An&#8217; there&#8217;s plenty little I don&#8217;t know
when it comes to .22 calibre en&#8217;mies like Blacarda.
The engineer took the cash an&#8217; then brought the whole
story to me. Us railroad men pull together, you
know. I told him to keep his $600 an&#8217; let the engine
break down accordin&#8217; to schedule. Then I came on
another train last night. Didn&#8217;t you see how pleased
Blacarda looked when he came into the <i>ho</i>tel? He
knows he ain&#8217;t got a ghost of a chance with his Starke
bill, while I&#8217;m on deck in the State House lobby.
Here&#8217;s our carriage. Come on, since you&#8217;re in such
a hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men splashed out through the sheets of
rain toward the waiting vehicle. Caine stood aside
to let Conover step in. As the latter&#8217;s foot was on
the step, the hotel telegraph clerk came running out,
calling the Fighter&#8217;s name and holding up a slip of
yellow paper whose message-ink was still wet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just came!&#8221; announced the clerk, handing Conover
the dispatch. &#8220;I thought you were still in the
hotel. Lucky I caught you before you started!&#8221;</p>

<p>Caleb made no reply. He was reading, and
re-reading, the telegram. Caine, watching him impatiently,
saw the Fighter&#8217;s face turn a muddy gray.</p>

<p>Then, shouting to the driver: &#8220;Union Station!
Go like Hell!&#8221; Conover was in the carriage. Caine,
all at a loss, had barely time to scramble in after him
before Caleb had slammed shut the door. The horses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
were off at full speed; the wheels dashing a cascade of
mud blotches through the vehicle&#8217;s lowered sash.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; insisted Caine, as Conover
huddled&mdash;inert, bulky, wordless&mdash;in one corner;
&#8220;whom are you to meet at the station? I thought all
the Assemblymen&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to catch the 9.32 to Granite if we can
make it,&#8221; growled Conover. &#8220;Shut up an&#8217; let me
think. Here!&#8221;</p>

<p>He shoved the tight-squeezed ball of yellow paper
toward Caine. The latter, as he took the telegram,
noted the sudden clammy chill of the Fighter&#8217;s hand
and saw that his lips were dry as a fever-patient&#8217;s.
Never before had Caine seen him nervous, and he
turned with redoubled interest to the unfolding of
the crumpled dispatch. It bore a woman&#8217;s signature&mdash;that
of Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s aunt&mdash;and Caine, marveling, ran
his eyes over the body of the message:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Dey taken dangerously ill last night. Delirious.
Calls for you all time. Come if can.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The banal wording, the crude phrasing for the
sake of saving expense&mdash;every detail of the telegram
jarred upon Caine&#8217;s fastidious taste. But a new
thought made him turn, incredulous, upon Conover.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully, <i>awfully</i> sorry to hear this,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;But&mdash;but of course you can&#8217;t think of leaving
everything at the State House to-day and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;State House?&#8221; muttered Conover, dully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you understand?&#8221; cried Caine, gripping the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
dazed, limp giant by the shoulder and trying to shake
him back to his senses. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you understand the
Steeloid fight will be on in an hour or so? You can&#8217;t
desert us and run off to Granite like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take your hands off me,&#8221; mumbled Conover, pettishly.
&#8220;Lord, how I hate to be pawed! Can&#8217;t that
driver go any faster&#8217;n a hearse? I&#8217;ll miss the&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Conover!</i>&#8221; fairly shouted Caine. &#8220;Brace up,
man! What ails you? I never saw you like this.
Have you lost your head? The Steeloid fight comes
up, in the Assembly, to-day. Your fortune and mine
hang on your killing the Starke bill. You say, yourself,
that unless you&#8217;re at the State House we&#8217;ll lose.
You <i>can&#8217;t</i> get to Granite and back before the session
closes. If&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not comin&#8217; back,&#8221; said Caleb in utter weariness.
&#8220;She&#8217;s&mdash;Dey&#8217;s sick. &#8216;Dangerously ill,&#8217; the
tel&#8217;gram said. An&#8217; she&#8217;s callin&#8217; all the time for <i>me</i>.
If the 9.32 is on time I ought to be to her house by
noon. Maybe before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, old man!&#8221; pleaded Caine. &#8220;Of
course I&#8217;m sorrier about Miss Shevlin than I can say.
But she will have the best possible medical care. And
you can&#8217;t help her by rushing off like this. Think of
all that depends on your being at the State House,
to-day. You can catch the six o&#8217;clock train for Granite
this evening, just as well. For all our sakes, don&#8217;t
desert us now! If Blacarda gets the Starke bill
through the Assembly&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother me,&#8221; snarled Conover, shifting his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
big body to move out of reach of the appealing hand.
&#8220;What&mdash;what d&#8217;ye s&#8217;pose can be the matter with
her? She was all right yesterday noon. Train leaves
in four minutes, an&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Caine broke in on the Fighter&#8217;s speech with a final
plea for sanity. He had an almost uncanny feeling at
his own proximity to this demoralized hulk of what
had until now been the strongest man of his world.
He did not know the shaking, muttering, putty-faced
being who in a trice had tossed away both their hopes
of fortune. Yet Caine would not yield.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll only stay just long enough for the Starke
bill to be voted on,&#8221; he implored. &#8220;You can have a
Special to take you back. Or, call up her doctor on
the long-distance telephone before you start, and find
out if her illness is really dangerous. Perhaps her
aunt&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s callin&#8217; for me,&#8221; reiterated Caleb, in the
same dead tones. &#8220;I thought about the long-distance
&#8217;phone. But there&#8217;s no time for that before the 9.32
starts. I&mdash;Good! Here&#8217;s the station! An&#8217; two
minutes to spare.&#8221;</p>

<p>Out of the carriage he jumped and made off at a
shambling run for the tracks; Caine close at his heels.
At the car platform the Fighter turned; scribbled a
few lines on a card and handed it to Caine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he ordered with a ghost of his old authority.
&#8220;Have that telegram sent off in a rush. It&#8217;ll
clear up the tracks for me when we strike the C. G. &amp;
X. line, an&#8217; let us in a half-hour earlier. Do as I say.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
Don&#8217;t bother me! I&#8217;ve no time to fool with the
measly Steeloid deal now.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For an hour and a half Caleb Conover stared with
unseeing, glazed eyes at the gray skies and rain-rotted
fields as his train sped toward Granite. He had a
curious numbness in his head. A dumb nausea
gripped him. For the first time in his life, he could
not think consecutively. All his mind and body
seemed to centre around one hideous truth: Desir&eacute;e
Shevlin was terribly ill. Perhaps dying. She
wanted him. And he was not there.</p>

<p>He had never known until now that he had an imagination.
Yet, during the century-long train ride,
the pressure on his brain lifted a bit from time to
time and he could see the dainty, dark little head turning
endlessly from side to side on its tumbled hot
pillow; the white face whence the glow and life had
been stricken; the delirium hoarse voice calling&mdash;ever
calling&mdash;for <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>She had been so bright, so happy, so strong&mdash;only
the day before. She had gone driving with him
after church. She had been telling him about a country
visit she was going to make&mdash;to-day&mdash;yes, she
was to have started to-day. This noon. And on the
same drive&mdash;what was it she had worn? It had
gone prettily with her eyes, whatever it was. Those
eyes of hers had such odd, wonderful little lights in
them. What color were they? And what was it
Caine had told her they held&mdash;oh, yes&mdash;&#8216;prisoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
laughter.&#8217; That was a queer sort of phrase. But
she had seemed to like it.</p>

<p>Why hadn&#8217;t the old fool who built the engine made
one that could travel faster than a hand car?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The express&mdash;thanks to Caleb&#8217;s track-clearing telegram&mdash;rolled
into Granite station a full half hour
ahead of time. Long before the cars came to a lurching
halt under the sheds, Conover, with all an old-time
railroad man&#8217;s deftness, had swung off the moving
train and had started down the platform at a run.
Through bevies of departing passengers he clove a
rough, unapologetic way. Station hands leaped nimbly
aside and gazed in gaping amaze after their hurrying
President. Past the platform, through the
vaulted waiting room toward the street beyond; and,
at the outer door&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Caleb!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Conover halted, dumbfounded, shaking, at the call.
There in the doorway he stood, his face a dull purple,
his eyes bulging, staring down at&mdash;Desir&eacute;e Shevlin.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth are you doing here?&#8221; she marvelled.
&#8220;You said you were to be at the Capital till
to-morrow. Isn&#8217;t it the squunchiest, trickliest day you
ever saw? If I hadn&#8217;t promised ever and ever so solemnly
to go out to Jean&#8217;s on the eleven-forty,
I&#8217;d&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good <i>Lord</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was as though all the engines on the C. G. &amp; X.
were letting off steam at once. And, with the ejaculation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
the cloud of horror was wiped clean from the
Fighter&#8217;s brain. He was, on the moment, his old self;
alive and masterful in every atom of his mighty body.</p>

<p>&#8220;Caleb!&#8221; the girl was saying, plaintively, as she
gazed up at him with her head on one side, &#8220;is your
hat <i>wished</i> on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I forgot!&#8221; he laughed, excitedly, doffing
the wet derby with one hand and slapping her
vigorously on her little rain-coated shoulder with the
other. &#8220;I came all the way back to Granite to tell
you I&#8217;m tickled to death to see you lookin&#8217; so well.
An&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217;&mdash;to tell you I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to beat Blacarda
yet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Caleb <i>Conover</i>!&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;<i>What</i> do you
think you are talking about? Are you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Conover had vanished&mdash;swallowed up in the
recesses of the dark station. Desir&eacute;e looked after
him, round-eyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sometimes think,&#8221; she confided to the silver handle
of her umbrella, &#8220;that Caleb will never <i>quite</i>
grow up!&#8221;</p>

<small>THE BATTLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The red-haired man was fighting.</p>

<p>Just now he was fighting at long range. And all
the complex system of the C. G. &amp; X. railroad vibrated
under his blows. A dozen rapid-fire orders had sent
as many station officials scuttling to posts of duty.
Already telegraph wires were sizzling; and employees
miles away were hustling in consequence, to fulfil their
master&#8217;s behests. The fastest engine on the C. G. &amp; X.
was getting up steam. A dozen frantic machinists
with oil cans, wrenches and hammers were swarming
over and under the huge locomotive making her ready
for a record trip. In the few minutes that remained,
before his Special could start, Caleb Conover, coolest,
least hurried man in the whole buzzing station, was
talking over the long-distance telephone to Caine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he was saying, as, cigar in mouth, he
lounged above the transmitter on his desk, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be off
in three minutes. So listen hard, for you are liable
to have a wakeful day before you. I&#8217;ve gave orders
to side-track everything on the C. G. &amp; X. between
here an&#8217; McIntyre Junction. That&#8217;ll give us room for
a sixty-five-mile-an-hour trip as far as the Junction.
After that I&#8217;ll be off the C. G. &amp; X. tracks and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
I&#8217;ll have to take my chances of gettin&#8217; the right
of way. But I guess a couple of tel&#8217;grams I&#8217;ve
sent will loosen things up on the other road. Remember,
I&#8217;m a&#8217; comin&#8217; as fast as steam will carry me.
Since you say the Starke bill ain&#8217;t come up yet, there&#8217;s
a show of my gettin&#8217; there on time, after all. I&#8217;ve
just &#8217;phoned Bourke, the Assemblyman from my
Districk, to hold the crowd together as well as he can
till I land. What? No, don&#8217;t you bother over that.
He knows how to keep the bill back for a while, anyhow.
Motion to adjourn&#8217;s always in order. He&#8217;ll
hop up an&#8217; move to adjourn ev&#8217;ry five minutes and
then demand a poll on the vote. Good ol&#8217;-fashioned
fil&#8217;busterin&#8217;. That, an&#8217; a few other cunnin&#8217; little stunts
that I&#8217;ve taught him, is liable to delay business pretty
much in the Assembly to-day. My crowd&#8217;s got all
their orders. But Blacarda was a roarin&#8217; fool not
to push the bill through early this mornin&#8217;. I s&#8217;pose
he figgered out he had all day ahead of him. Him an&#8217;
me will settle our score later. So long! My engine&#8217;s
ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clambering aboard the locomotive cab the moment
the last oiler scuttled to safety from underneath the
driving-wheels, Conover lighted a fresh cigar, and
with a grim smile leaned back to enjoy the whirlwind
flight through the rain. He was happier than he had
been in weeks. Not only through the quick lifting of
the horror that had so engulfed him, but from the joy
of a hard fight against heavy odds. In spite of his
cheery tone toward Caine, he knew it was problematical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
whether or not his henchman, Bourke, could retard the
vote on the Starke Bill until his arrival. But it was a
chance well worth the taking. His anxiety for Desir&eacute;e
banished, the Fighter turned with more than
wonted zeal to the battle before him.</p>

<p>The engine thundered over the miles of sodden land,
the cab windows awash with rain; the great bulk swaying
perilously from its own reckless speed; the
twisting of sharp curves more than once hurling Caleb
headlong from his seat. Past long lines of side-tracked
freight and passenger trains they whizzed. Every
switch along the line bore its burden of cars hustled
off the main line by Caleb&#8217;s commands. The entire
C. G. &amp; X. system was for the time tied up, that its
ruler might travel over its rails as no man had before
traversed them.</p>

<p>&#8220;At this rate,&#8221; mused Caleb, &#8220;I&#8217;ll make it, with
any sort of luck. If I can be sure of speed on the
other line&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>Toward the latest of many brown wooden stations
they flashed. The engineer threw over a lever. The
wheels shrieked ear-splitting protest as they gripped
and shaved the rails in the shock of the brake&#8217;s clutch.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; bellowed Conover, wrathfully.
&#8220;Is&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Station agent&#8217;s flagging us, sir, with the danger
signal,&#8221; replied the engineer, leaning out into the rain
to accost a scared, shirtsleeved man who ran toward
them, flag in hand, along the track.</p>

<p>Conover pulled the engineer to one side and thrust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
his own head from the cab window, just as the panting
station agent came up.</p>

<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye mean by stoppin&#8217; us?&#8221; demanded the
Fighter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trackwalker reports&mdash;bridge&mdash;mile above&mdash;unsafe,&mdash;from
washout!&#8221; puffed the agent.</p>

<p>&#8220;He does, hey?&#8221; sneered Conover, &#8220;An&#8217; why in
blazes didn&#8217;t you telegraph the next station below?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just going to, sir,&#8221; faltered the agent, &#8220;but
as there wasn&#8217;t any train due for an half an hour&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the bridge still standin&#8217;?&#8221; demanded Conover.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. But the trackwalker thinks&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t pay him to think. <i>I&#8217;m</i> doin&#8217; the thinkin&#8217;
this trip. Davis,&#8221; wheeling on the engineer, &#8220;I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; over this bridge. There&#8217;s $500 on the other side
of it for <i>you</i>. Want to come? Speak up quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If&mdash;if it&#8217;s not safe&mdash;&#8221; hesitated the man. &#8220;This
is the heaviest engine on the road and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out of here, then!&#8221; yelled Conover, ejecting
him bodily from the cab. The engineer missed the
step and tumbled prone in a blasphemous heap, to the
wet track side. Conover did not waste a second look
at him, but slipped into the driver&#8217;s place and threw
off the brake. He had served his term as engineer
during his upward flight through the various grades
of railroad achievement; and was as comfortably at
home at the throttle as in his private car.</p>

<p>The wheels caught the track and the great mass of
metal sprang into motion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>&#8220;Is there anything else <i>I</i> can do, sir?&#8221; piped the
obsequious agent.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; snarled Caleb glowering back at him
through the open window. &#8220;If there was, you
wouldn&#8217;t be a measly thirty-dollar-a-month station
roustabout.&#8221;</p>

<p>Settling into his place, Conover knit his red brows
and peered forward through the downpour and mist,
along the shining track. He could not afford the time
he had lost. To make it up, every notch of speed must
be crowded on. There was a fierce exhilaration in
Caleb&#8217;s alert light eyes, as he set himself to his new
task. The fireman, who had been crouching on the
tender, now worked his way forward into the cab.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; grunted Conover, crossly. &#8220;I&#8217;d forgot
<i>you</i>. I s&#8217;pose I got to slow up while you jump.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I was a jumper, sir,&#8221; replied the fireman,
quietly, &#8220;I&#8217;d have gotten off at the station.&#8221;</p>

<p>With stolid unconcern the fellow set about stoking.
Conover grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we live past that bridge,&#8221; he remarked,
&#8220;You&#8217;ll make your next trip as pass&#8217;nger engineer.
Steady, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The locomotive was at top speed once more.
Around a curve it tore, listing far to one side.
Straight ahead, through the gray murk, rose the
trestled bridge&mdash;a blur of brownish-red, spanning a
hundred foot drop; at whose bottom boiled a froth of
white fretted water cut here and there by black lump-head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
boulders. &#8220;Slow to 10 miles an Hour!&#8221; read
the patch of signboard at the bridge&#8217;s head. At either
side of the railroad embankment stood knots of
country folk, idly watching the condemned framework.</p>

<p>At sixty miles an hour the locomotive swept into
the straightaway. A scattering chorus of cries rose
from a dozen lips as the shadowy giant bulk leaped
out of the mist.</p>

<p>Then, in the same instant, the dull rumble of wheels
on a ground track was changed to the hollow roaring
roll of wheels on a trestle. A jar of impact&mdash;a sickening
sway of the whole wood-and-steel structure&mdash;a
snapping, rending sound from somewhere far below&mdash;a
wind-borne scream from the group of panic-stricken
idlers now a furlong behind;&mdash;and once
more the changed key of the driving-wheels&#8217; song told
that the flimsy bridgeway was succeeded by solid roadbed
beneath the rails.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scared?&#8221; asked Conover, over his shoulder, to the
fireman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just been too near to death to feel like lying,&#8221;
returned the man in a sickly attempt at humor, &#8220;So I
might as well own up that for a second or so I could
hear a few harps twanging. My heart&#8217;s still somewhere
around the place where I swallow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got grit,&#8221; vouchsafed the Fighter, straining
his eyes to pierce through the mist in front of them,
&#8220;Man&#8217;s made of dust, the parsons say; but I guess
there was plenty of sand sprinkled in yours an&#8217; mine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
An&#8217; I like you better for not bein&#8217; ashamed to tell you
was afraid. The brave man ain&#8217;t the one who don&#8217;t
get scared; he&#8217;s the feller who&#8217;s scared stiff and goes
ahead just the same. I guess I&#8217;ll have to change
that new job of yours from pass&#8217;nger engineer to
somethin&#8217; in my own office. Now, chase back to your
work. I&#8217;ve got other things to think of besides
jawin&#8217; with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Junction was reached and passed. No longer
on his own road, Conover was less certain that the
way would be left clear for him. Yet his telegrams
had had effect. The line was open, and he sent his
locomotive along with no let-up in its terrific speed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make it,&#8221; he said once, under his breath. &#8220;If
Bourke can only hold &#8217;em&mdash;if he can only hold &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>Over went the lever, and with another shrill shriek
the engine slackened speed. They had rounded a
bend. Directly in front was a station. Beside it
stood a long train, blocking the single track. In a
bound, Conover was out of the cab. Shouting to the
fireman to follow, he set off at a run through the mud
puddles that lined the right of way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatcher stoppin&#8217; for?&#8221; he demanded of the conductor
who stood by one of the rear cars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waiting for the Directors of the road,&#8221; answered
the conductor. &#8220;They&#8217;re lunching up at the President&#8217;s
house. They were due here three minutes ago.
This train&#8217;s a local, so we&#8217;re holding it till&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Conover heard no more but broke again into a run;
heading for the engine.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>&#8220;Do you mind gettin&#8217; into trouble?&#8221; he panted to
the fireman at his side, &#8220;I&#8217;ll stand by you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the boss,&#8221; replied the man, laconically, putting
on a fresh burst of speed to keep up with his employer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to steal that engine. You uncouple
her an&#8217; scramble aboard. I&#8217;ll &#8217;tend to the
crew.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had reached the locomotive as he spoke. The
engineer had left his cab and was stretching his
cramped legs on the platform. His fireman lolled
from the window, smoking a pipe. Conover, never
breaking his stride, swung aboard the cab and threw
open the throttle; the same moment his follower
yanked loose the old-fashioned coupling pin, disengaged
the air brake and gained the tender with a flying
leap.</p>

<p>The whole transaction was completed before either
the engine&#8217;s crew knew what was going on. The
rightful fireman found himself toppled from the cab
straight into the arms of the engineer, who with a
yell had sprung aboard. The two, clasped lovingly in
each other&#8217;s arms, rolled swearing into a roadside
mud-puddle;&mdash;and the locomotive was off.</p>

<p>Conover, at the throttle, laughed aloud in keen delight
as he glanced back at the engineless train, the two
bedraggled figures and the crowd that came running
excitedly along the platform.</p>

<p>&#8220;This old rattler ain&#8217;t a patch on the one we left
behind,&#8221; he chuckled, &#8220;but she seems able to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
some speed for all that. Gee, but I&#8217;ll have my hands
full squarin&#8217; myself with the Pres&#8217;dent of this road!
I&#8217;m li&#8217;ble to hear some fine language an&#8217; maybe have a
nice little suit to compromise, too. But we&#8217;ll get there.
It&#8217;d a&#8217; held us up half an hour or more, to wait for
that measly local to hit a switch. Ever steal an engine
before, son?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the fireman, &#8220;and I&#8217;m just wondering
how I&#8217;ll look in striped clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You&#8217;ll</i> be all right. Take that from me. It
means promotion. That&#8217;s all. If our trip lasts long
enough, you&#8217;re li&#8217;ble to be Pres&#8217;dent of the C. G. &amp; X.
at this rate. Say, I wonder when this engine took on
water last. Look an&#8217; see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right for the rest of the run,&#8221; reported the
fireman, on his return. &#8220;But suppose they telegraph
ahead and have us run into an open switch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought of that. But they won&#8217;t. In the first
place, they won&#8217;t risk smashin&#8217; a good engine. In
the second,&mdash;Hell! Ain&#8217;t I Caleb Conover?&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A hatless man,&mdash;dripping wet, mud-smeared,
grimy as a coal heaver,&mdash;took the State House steps
three at a stride. In less than two minutes it was
known throughout the Assembly that Caleb Conover
had come. A word here, a hint there, a pulling of
mysterious wires:&mdash;and the wavering backbones of
his more doubtful satellites in the Legislature were
miraculously stiffened. The Starke Bill had not yet
come to a vote; thanks to Bourke and his colleagues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
who had wearied the Assembly to desperation and
maddened Blacarda to frenzy by a continuous series of
the most glaring filibuster tactics. But even the Conover
faction&#8217;s tactics had, at the last, wellnigh exhausted
themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;In another five minutes,&#8221; Caine was explaining,
&#8220;you&#8217;d have been too late. Nothing could have
stopped the bill from&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another five minutes!&#8221; mocked Conover, turning
from his work. &#8220;Son, this ain&#8217;t the first, nor yet
the millionth time that a diff&#8217;rence of five minutes has
knocked hist&#8217;ry into a cocked hat. Now, send McGuckin
to me. He needs a little more beguilin&#8217;. An&#8217;
I&#8217;m here to give it to him. Chase, now! He&#8217;s the
last I&#8217;ll have time to see, before the vote.&#8221;</p>

<p>Conover did not so much as trouble to go to the
Assembly gallery with Caine when the Starke bill came
up for balloting; but sat smoking and glancing over
papers in the Committee room that he had commandeered
as his personal office. Hither, soon afterward,
Caine repaired; his handsome, tired face alight.</p>

<p>&#8220;We win!&#8221; he announced triumphantly. &#8220;The
bill&#8217;s defeated,&mdash;by two votes. Congratulations!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Son,&#8221; observed Conover, glancing up from his
desk, &#8220;what&#8217;s all the excitement? I told you last
Friday that we&#8217;d win by two votes. Now, maybe,
you&#8217;ll believe, another time, that I know what I&#8217;m
talkin&#8217; about. Where&#8217;s Blacarda?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I passed him in the corridor on his way back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
the hotel. Why do you ask? You&#8217;re done with him
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Done</i> with him?&#8221; echoed Conover. &#8220;Why,
man, I ain&#8217;t <i>begun</i> with him yet. I was just waitin&#8217;
to find where he&#8217;d gone. So long. See you at the
<i>ho</i>tel before train time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Conover walked out of the office, leaving Caine staring
after him in perplexity. Straight to the hotel the
Fighter drove. Arriving there he went, unannounced,
to Blacarda&#8217;s room; entered without knocking, and
closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>Blacarda looked up from the task of packing his
suit case. Bareheaded, still grimy and disheveled,
Conover stood facing him. Blacarda rose from his
knees beside the open suit case and started forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you know why I&#8217;m here?&#8221; hazarded
Caleb, looking across at the well-groomed figure, without
the faintest trace of emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;To crow over your dirty, underhand victory of
to-day?&#8221; blazed the other. &#8220;If so you can save yourself
the trouble. Leave my room at once. I don&#8217;t
wish it polluted or&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll have to stand a little more polootion before
I&#8217;m ready to go,&#8221; answered Conover, unmoved.
&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t come to crow. Crowin&#8217; ain&#8217;t in my
line. A little while ago I set a man to tracin&#8217; a
tel&#8217;gram I got this mornin&#8217;. It seems <i>you</i> wrote it
an&#8217; paid the <i>ho</i>tel tel&#8217;graph clerk $10 to slip it to me
at the right time. Don&#8217;t lie. I&#8217;ve got proof.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m not given to lying,&#8221; retorted Blacarda.
&#8220;And if I were, I shouldn&#8217;t take the trouble to lie to
a blackleg like you. Yes, I wrote the telegram.
What of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a sweet-scented sort of a cuss to preach
about &#8216;dirty, underhand vict&#8217;ries,&#8217; ain&#8217;t you?&#8221; said
Caleb, thoughtfully. &#8220;After tryin&#8217; to get me out of
the way like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any weapon is justifiable against a scoundrel,&#8221;
sneered Blacarda. &#8220;One must fight fire with fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; assented Caleb. &#8220;Though not as original
as I&#8217;d &#8217;a expected from a clever chap like you.
Fightin&#8217; fire with fire is good finance. So when you
tipped an engineer $600 to get me delayed in comin&#8217;
here, I made no kick. That was fair game. I&#8217;d
a&#8217; done the same thing myself. Only I wouldn&#8217;t a&#8217;
bungled it like <i>you</i> did. When you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to do a
crooked thing do it well. Don&#8217;t foozle it an&#8217; lose your
fight....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t your experience in hold-up tactics,&#8221; answered
Blacarda, &#8220;so perhaps I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Caleb waved aside the interpolation and went on in
the same heavy, emotionless voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was all fair, like I said. But it failed.
Then, what&#8217;d you do? Dragged a woman&#8217;s name into
the row. Faked a dispatch tellin&#8217; me <i>she</i> was dyin&#8217;
an&#8217; callin&#8217; for me. That&#8217;s a trick <i>I</i> wouldn&#8217;t play if
my life was hangin&#8217; on a deal. You used that little
girl&#8217;s name to get me away. You put up that filthy
job,&mdash;an&#8217; took another man into your conf&#8217;dence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Told a measly, tattlin&#8217; tel&#8217;graph clerk about <i>her</i>.
I ain&#8217;t any good at expressin&#8217; myself. But say! I
wish I could get it through that shiny head of yours
what a rotten, low down, crawly cur you are! No,
don&#8217;t put on no heroics! <i>I&#8217;m</i> doin&#8217; the talkin&#8217; now.
In the fake tel&#8217;gram, you used the nickname you&#8217;ve
heard her called. You used the knowledge that I&#8217;d
hustle from here to hell if I could be of use to her.
You used all that as means to get me away from your
p&#8217;litical dogfight to-day. An&#8217; how did you get your
knowledge of her nickname an&#8217; &#8217;bout my carin&#8217; for her
as if she was my own kid? Hey? You got it while
you was callin&#8217; on her. While you was takin&#8217; her
hosp&#8217;tality. You used that kind of trick in <i>politics</i>!
God! I didn&#8217;t think there was a breathin&#8217; man could
do such a thing. No ward-heeler could do it&mdash;it
had to be done by a &#8216;gentleman.&#8217; One of the Arareek
Governors.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused for breath. Blacarda, reddening under
the tirade&#8217;s lash, nevertheless sought to laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he queried with really excellent coolness,
&#8220;what are you going to do about it? Of course you
can bring suit,&mdash;and probably recover. But Miss
Shevlin&#8217;s name will certainly figure rather unpleasantly
in the newspaper reports of the case. I&#8217;m sorry I was
forced to use such means,&mdash;I still believe them justifiable
in dealing with a man like you,&mdash;but I fail to see
what redress you have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see presently,&#8221; replied Caleb, with no trace
of threat in his dull voice. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
I&#8217;m not totin&#8217; this into court. What good would your
measly damage money do me? An&#8217; I&#8217;m not goin&#8217; to
tell your friends of it with the hope they&#8217;d turn you
out of s&#8217;ciety. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to punish you the only way
a rotten trick like that <i>can</i> be punished. The only
way a skunk like you could be made to smart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Blacarda, a shadow
of uneasiness showing through his rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean I&#8217;ve come here to give you the biggest
thrashin&#8217; you ever got. An&#8217; now&#8217;s the time I begin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blacarda, at the slow forward motion of Caleb&#8217;s
body, sprang furiously at the Fighter. He was a
strong man; large and well built. But he might as
well have tried to stop the rush of a charging bull-elephant
as to block Caleb&#8217;s attack. Not even taking
the pains to guard the heavy left-hander that Blacarda
drove full into his face, Conover was upon his
foe.</p>

<p>Backward across the room Caleb drove the other
with a lightning succession of short arm blows that
battered down Blacarda&#8217;s guard and smashed with
fearful force upon his head and body. To escape
the merciless hail of fists, Blacarda ducked and
clinched.</p>

<p>Conover shook him off as though his antagonist had
been a cripple, and ran in again to the assault. One
right-hand blow crashed into Blacarda&#8217;s face and
hurled him backward against the wall. As he rebounded
forward from sheer shock of the double<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
impact, Conover&#8217;s left fist caught him flush on the jaw
and he collapsed senseless to the floor.</p>

<p>Conover was at the unconscious body before it had
fairly touched ground. He beat with insane rage
upon the upturned, defenseless face, hammering it to
a pulp; growling and whining all the time between his
hard-set teeth; like some rabid jungle beast worrying
its meat.</p>

<p>Caine flung open the door and ran into the room;&mdash;thereby
in all probability saving Blacarda&#8217;s life.
Taking in the scene at a glance, he launched himself
upon the growling, mauling victor. With all his wiry
strength, he sought to drag Conover away from the
senseless man. But his utmost muscular power was
as nothing to that of the giant who was still wreaking
brute vengeance on the inert mass beneath him.</p>

<p>At length, employing a wrestling device, Caine
managed to drag the unprepared Fighter backward,
from behind; and by a sudden wrench to throw him
to one side. Still keeping behind Conover, out of
reach of the hammer-fists, the slighter man succeeded
in pinioning Caleb&#8217;s arms by slipping his own hands
and wrists between the other&#8217;s elbows and his body.
Trussed up, helpless as he was, Caleb writhed and
snarled like a leashed bulldog. In another moment he
would have wrenched himself free by dint of main
force, had not Caine&#8217;s voice at last penetrated the red
wrath-mists of his brain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Conover!&#8221; his friend was shouting, for the tenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
time, &#8220;if you kill him, Miss Shevlin&#8217;s name will be
brought into the affair! Can&#8217;t you see that? If&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Conover&#8217;s iron-tense muscles relaxed. The orgasm
of Berserk rage had passed, leaving him spent
and apathetic. Caine knew that sanity had returned
to the Fighter, and he released his grip on the mighty
arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; he observed, facing the dazed, panting
man, and setting to rights his own tumbled clothing,
&#8220;You are a nice specimen of humanity to have at
large in a civilized country! You might have killed
him. You <i>would</i> have killed him, I believe, if I
hadn&#8217;t come when I did. I got to thinking over what
you said at the State House and I was afraid something
like this would happen. So I came on. Just in
time, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caine, as he spoke, had knelt beside the battered,
bleeding Thing on the floor. Now he crossed to the
washstand and came back with a soaked towel. Talking
as he worked over the unconscious figure, he
added:</p>

<p>&#8220;You were right to thrash him. He richly deserved
it. But, why the deuce did you keep on pummeling
him while he was down? Does that strike
you as sportsmanlike?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sportsmanlike?&#8221; panted Conover, his big voice
still shaking with ground-swells of the storm that had
mastered him, &#8220;Sportsmanlike, hey? D&#8217;ye s&#8217;pose
I came here for a measly athletic contest? I came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
here to lick that curly, perfumed whelp. An&#8217; I did it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hit him when he was down,&#8221; answered Caine,
crossing again from the washstand and dashing cold
water in Blacarda&#8217;s shapeless face. &#8220;And&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I hit him when he was down!&#8221; snorted
Caleb. &#8220;What d&#8217;ye s&#8217;pose I was goin&#8217; to do? Help
him up an&#8217; brush off his clo&#8217;es? Gee, it makes me
sick to hear that old fossil rot about &#8216;not hittin&#8217; a man
when he&#8217;s down!&#8217; What in thunder&#8217;s the use of
gettin&#8217; him down if you ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to hit him? I
didn&#8217;t come here for a friendly boxin&#8217; bout. I came
to pay Blacarda off. An&#8217; he wasn&#8217;t to be paid off by
one little tap that&#8217;d knock him over. That was just
the start. I guess he&#8217;ll know enough by now to let
Dey Shevlin&#8217;s name alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caine made no answer. He was deftly applying
the simple prize-ring expedients for restoring beaten
pugilists to their senses. Conover looked down at him
in profound contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; went on the Fighter, &#8220;I s&#8217;pose in <i>your</i> gold-shirt
world, folks would say I was all kinds of a cad
to keep on punishin&#8217; that swine after I&#8217;d bowled him
off his legs. But them same folks will jump with
both feet on a business man when there&#8217;s a rumor
that he&#8217;s broke. They&#8217;ll join in a run on a bank that&#8217;s
in trouble. Their saintly women&#8217;ll take pious joy in
chasin&#8217; to hell some poor girl who&#8217;s made a fool of
herself. But they&#8217;d roll up their eyes at the sight of
me lickin&#8217; Blacarda after he&#8217;s keeled over. What&#8217;n<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
blazes is the use of gettin&#8217; a man down if you ain&#8217;t
goin&#8217; to hit him? It&#8217;s the A. B. C. of business.
Why, Caine, you make me tired!&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes fell on his own torn, bleeding knuckles.
He gazed at them in slow surprise; then sauntered
over to bathe them. The glass above the washstand
revealed to him a face pasty white, smeared with coal-dust
smears and blood, and swollen from a blow on
the mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m an engagin&#8217; lookin&#8217; spectacle, all right,&#8221; he
soliloquized as he bent to wash. &#8220;Lucky I left my
suit case at the <i>ho</i>tel this morning. I&#8217;ll need a lot of
dressin&#8217; and massagin&#8217; before I can go to see Dey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blacarda groaned feebly, and moved his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s coming around,&#8221; reported Caine. &#8220;Now
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to telephone down for the hotel doctor.
While he&#8217;s on his way here you can think of some
story to tell him that will account for Blacarda&#8217;s condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell him the truth,&#8221; said Caleb, simply. &#8220;All
except the part about Dey. An&#8217; I guess Blacarda
ain&#8217;t likely to tell <i>that</i>, either. But what&#8217;s the use of
a doctor? The cur&#8217;s gettin&#8217; his senses back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you fractured at least one of his ribs, when
your knee was jammed down on his chest,&#8221; answered
Caine. &#8220;It feels so to me. Besides, unless his face
is to be distorted and hideous for life it must have
medical care at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blacarda lifted his unrecognizable visage and
opened the one eye which was not wholly hidden from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
view by his swollen flesh. Caine raised the injured
man to a sitting posture and held a whiskey flask to
the torn, discolored lips. Through the hedge of
smashed teeth and down the swelled throat the stinging
liquor glided. Blacarda gulped it down, sat motionless
for a moment, then groaned again and looked
about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; growled Caleb, &#8220;do you want any more?&#8221;</p>

<p>One long second Blacarda squinted vacantly at his
conqueror. Then, with a shuddering scream of terror,
he buried his mangled face in Caine&#8217;s shoulder
and lay there, quivering and sobbing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a beast you are, Conover!&#8221; exclaimed
Caine, in revolt.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; assented Caleb, cheerfully. &#8220;But
I&#8217;ve just broke a worse one. Broke him body an&#8217;
spirit. Not such a bad day&#8217;s work!&#8221;</p>

<small>CALEB CONOVER STORMS A RAMPART</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Caleb Conover was finishing a solitary breakfast
in his room; the morning after his return from the
Capital. He had eaten heartily, even as he had slept
well; and was neither outwardly nor inwardly the
worse for his &#8220;wakeful day&#8221; at State House and
engine-throttle. A slightly puffed underlip and a
double set of discolored knuckles were his only mementoes
of the attack upon Blacarda.</p>

<p>In honor of his victories, the Fighter had allowed
himself an extra half-hour&#8217;s sleep and a steak for
breakfast. It was nine o&#8217;clock so he pushed back his
chair from the deal table that had held his morning
meal. He lighted a heavy cigar, rose, stretched himself
in the lazy luxury of perfect strength, and prepared
to go to the day&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>Conover, in the early years, when he was fighting
tooth and nail to lift the moribund C. G. &amp; X. Railroad
to a paying basis, had had a room and bath fitted
up for his personal use, directly to the rear of his
private office in the station. Here he had lived, his
entire life centering about his toil.</p>

<p>Here he still dwelt, now that success was his. The
man whose wealth had already passed the million<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
mark and was rocketing toward far higher figures,
was simpler in his personal tastes and surroundings
than was the poorest brakeman on his road. An iron
cot bed, a painted pine bureau with flawed mirror, an
air-tight stove, a shelf with fourteen books, the deal
table and two chairs formed the sum of his living-room
furniture. One of the station scrubwomen kept
the place in order. The few personal guests he had
were received in the private office outside.</p>

<p>One such visitor, Conover had been informed ten
minutes earlier, was even now awaiting him there.
At least Caleb, reading the card, &#8220;Mr. John
Hawarden, Jr.,&#8221; judged the caller to have come on a
personal matter of some sort rather than on railroad
business.</p>

<p>With mild curiosity as to what could have brought
the son of Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s chaperone to see him, Conover
lounged in leisurely fashion to the office.</p>

<p>On his appearance, a tall, slender youth rose and
greeted him with nervous cordiality.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; grunted Conover, scowling under the
vigorous grip of the lad&#8217;s hand. &#8220;What can I do for
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The caller twisted his neck somewhat uneasily in its
amazing height of collar, fought back a gulp and fell
to drawing his tan gloves through his fingers. Caleb
noted that the hands were slim, the fingers long and
tapering. He also noted that the boy, despite his
almost effeminate delicacy of contour and feature,
was square of jaw and steady of eye. The Fighter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
was, from these signs of the Brotherhood of Strength,
amused rather than irritated at the other&#8217;s nervousness.
He even felt a vague desire to set Hawarden at his
ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;First time you an&#8217; me have come together, ain&#8217;t
it?&#8221; he asked, less gruffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; answered Hawarden pleasantly. &#8220;I
know you by sight,&mdash;and of course by reputation,&mdash;but
it&#8217;s hardly likely you&#8217;d have noticed <i>me</i>. My parents
have had the pleasure of meeting you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pleasure, hey?&#8221; queried Caleb. &#8220;That&#8217;s what
<i>they</i> called it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hawarden flushed painfully, as at some not wholly
glad memory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind thinkin&#8217; up a comeback,&#8221; grinned
Caleb. &#8220;Us two don&#8217;t speak quite the same language.
My mistake. Now,&#8221; dropping into the office manner
habitual to him, &#8220;What do you want? I take it you&#8217;re
not makin&#8217; a round of social calls an&#8217; choosin&#8217; this
for the first stoppin&#8217; place. What can I do for you?
Come to the point quick, please. I&#8217;m li&#8217;ble to be pretty
busy to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hawarden smiled back in an engaging fashion that
held no hint of fear. For this, Caleb again felt somewhat
drawn to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on a horribly cheeky errand,&#8221; began the
youth, &#8220;And, to tell you the truth, I&#8217;m scared stiff.
I came to speak to you on a rather delicate subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw the &#8216;delicate subject&#8217; that wasn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
the better for being dragged out into the fresh air.
Get to the point, son. I&#8217;m busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am here, sir,&#8221; said the boy with a labored formality
that spoke of much rehearsal, &#8220;to speak to you
of Miss Desir&eacute;e Shevlin. You are her guardian, I
understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caleb&#8217;s glare of utter and displeased astonishment
checked the speaker for the briefest instant. But,
swallowing hurriedly, he continued his set speech:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the honor&mdash;the undeserved honor, sir,&mdash;to
request your leave to ask Miss Shevlin to be my
wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was out! Hawarden relaxed the knuckle-whitening
grip of his fists. His forehead grew moist.
So did his palms. Nor did Caleb&#8217;s attitude lessen the
awkwardness of the moment. With open mouth the
Fighter sat staring at his guest. At last he found
words&mdash;just a few of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well I&#8217;ll be damned!&#8221; he sputtered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; said Hawarden, taking new hold
of his sliding courage. &#8220;It seems to me a more honorable
thing to ask your consent,&mdash;as Miss Shevlin&#8217;s
guardian&mdash;before daring to offer myself to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Son!&#8221; observed Caleb, profoundly, &#8220;If you had
a little more sense you&#8217;d be half-witted!&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy got to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is your right, I suppose,&#8221; he answered stiffly,
&#8220;to insult me. You are an older man than I, and I
come to you as an applicant for&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You read all that in a book,&#8221; snorted Caleb.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
&#8220;Cut it out and get down to sense. No one&#8217;s insultin&#8217;
you and no one&#8217;s stompin&#8217; on your buddin&#8217;
dignity. You can&#8217;t wonder I was took aback when
you sprung that mine on me. I ain&#8217;t up in the by-laws
an&#8217; constitootion of p&#8217;lite s&#8217;ciety. If it&#8217;s the usual thing
to come over with a line of talk like you just got out
of your system&mdash;, why I&#8217;m sorry if I acted rough.
There! Now, sit down and talk sense. So it&#8217;s the
custom to ask a girl&#8217;s guardian before askin&#8217; <i>her</i>?
Nice, ree-fined idee. But I guess if ev&#8217;rybody did it
there wouldn&#8217;t be a terrible lot of work for the
marriage license clerks. An&#8217;&mdash;why, you&#8217;re just a
<i>kid</i>!&#8221; he broke out. &#8220;What in blazes are you babblin&#8217;
about marryin&#8217; for? Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be twenty-two next month!&#8221; answered the
boy proudly. &#8220;I think I am entitled to be treated as
a man. Not a&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, all right! all right!&#8221; chuckled Caleb. &#8220;I
was the same way. Used to tickle me to death at
twenty to be called &#8216;Old Man.&#8217; <i>Now</i>, I&#8217;d give five
dollars to anyone who&#8217;d call me &#8216;My Boy.&#8217; So you
think I ought to treat you like a grown man, hey? All
right!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was enjoying the scene hugely. He liked the
boy&#8217;s pluck. Fighter-like, he was minded to test it
to the full. As a possible husband for Desir&eacute;e, he did
not give Hawarden a thought. As a momentary
means of amusement to himself, he was willing to prolong
the interview.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll s&#8217;pose you&#8217;re a man, then,&#8221; he continued.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
&#8220;An&#8217; you want to marry my ward. Your fam&#8217;ly&#8217;s
as good as hers. Maybe better, as you folks count
such things. So much for that. Now, what&#8217;s your
income? There, don&#8217;t look like I&#8217;d made a face at
you! The question&#8217;s in order. Maybe you think
money don&#8217;t count in matrimony? Well, it does.
Respectability ain&#8217;t on the Free List. Not by a long
shot. A fam&#8217;ly costs three times as much to keep as
a chorus girl. What&#8217;s your income? Speak up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I hardly know, exactly,&#8221; faltered Hawarden,
&#8220;When I was in college, my father allowed me $1,500
a year. He still keeps it up. But as I&#8217;m living at
home now, it costs me less to get on. Then, after I
finish the law-school next year, I&#8217;ll be making a good
salary myself very soon. With Miss Shevlin to work
for&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To put it plain,&#8221; interrupted Caleb, &#8220;You&#8217;re
earnin&#8217; nothin&#8217; just now, with a golden outlook of
earnin&#8217; a little less in a year or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have my allowance,&#8221; protested Hawarden,
&#8220;and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll cut out the &#8216;allowonce&#8217; part,&#8221; said Caleb.
&#8220;That&#8217;s just what your father pays as part of his fine
for bringin&#8217; you into the world. He&#8217;s li&#8217;ble to get
sore on you any time an&#8217; stop playin&#8217; the alloorin&#8217; role
of Human Meal Ticket. What&#8217;ll you do then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t quite understand,&#8221; protested Hawarden.
&#8220;In a year from now I shall be earning my own living
and shall not be dependent on my father. There is
good money in law and&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>&#8220;There is!&#8221; assented Caleb. &#8220;I&#8217;ve put a lot of it
there, myself, from time to time. But blamed few
lawyers manage to get it out. The rest go to work
on street cars or&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall make my way,&#8221; averred the lad stoutly,
&#8220;and even if I don&#8217;t succeed at the law, I always have
my literary work to fall back on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My literary work. I was Yale correspondent for
the <i>Star</i> all the time I was at college. And more of
my stories are being accepted all the time by papers
and magazines. And,&#8221; seeking mightily to subdue
the thrill of sublime pride in his voice and to speak
in a matter-of-fact tone, as he played his trump
card, &#8220;Last month I had a seven-page story in
<i>Scribner&#8217;s</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked Caleb, genuinely curious.</p>

<p>&#8220;In <i>Scribner&#8217;s</i>&#8221; repeated Hawarden modestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that?&#8221; inquired Caleb.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s,&mdash;why <i>Scribner&#8217;s Magazine</i>,&#8221; explained the
boy, in dire misery. &#8220;I got eighty dollars for it,&#8221; he
added with a pitiful clutch at his vanishing self-respect.</p>

<p>Caleb&#8217;s eye brightened. He looked at Hawarden
with a new interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eighty dollars?&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;How long&#8217;d it
take you to write it out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About three days, I think,&#8221; answered the boy,
puzzled at the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! Not so bad. Hundred an&#8217; sixty dollars a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
week; with Sunday off. Why don&#8217;t you stick to that
instead of messin&#8217; around with the law?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the tenth story I&#8217;d sent them,&#8221; confessed
Hawarden, heroically. &#8220;And it was the first one they
took. That&#8217;s the trouble with literature. It&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, as things stand now,&#8221; pursued Caleb, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
no real money. No sure prospects. An&#8217; you want
to marry Dey Shevlin. You want her to share your
nothin&#8217;-a-year. Or,&#8221; he grated, &#8220;maybe you think
it&#8217;d be nice to live on <i>her</i> cash?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think nothing of the sort!&#8221; flared Hawarden,
scarlet with anger. &#8220;I&#8217;ll not stand that sort of talk
even from <i>her</i> guardian. I wouldn&#8217;t touch a penny
of any woman&#8217;s money if I were starving! I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds kind of like a book, too,&#8221; commented
Caleb. &#8220;But you mean it. I&#8217;m glad you do.
I think I kind of like you. So instead of throwin&#8217;
you downstairs, I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to waste a whole minute
talkin&#8217; to you. You&#8217;re a nice kid. You come here
bristlin&#8217; with book learnin&#8217; an&#8217; idees of honor an&#8217; you
make your little speech to the stony hearted guardian
an&#8217; stand ready to say &#8216;God bless you, sir, for them
kind words!&#8217; or &#8216;You&#8217;ve busted two young hearts!&#8217;
No, you needn&#8217;t squirm. It&#8217;s so. But you can rub
both those remarks off the slate. Neither of &#8217;em&#8217;ll be
needed. You&#8217;ve the good sense to fall in love with
the dandiest girl that ever happened. But what have
you got to offer her? Besides your valuable self, I
mean? You&#8217;re askin&#8217; for the greatest thing in all this
world. Do you give anything in exchange? Not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
you. You want her,&mdash;her with her pretty ways, an&#8217;
clever brain an&#8217; gorgeous little face. An&#8217; you can&#8217;t
even support her. You can&#8217;t even say: &#8216;I&#8217;ve got ten
dollars a week of my own. I&#8217;ll give it all to her.&#8217;
You&#8217;ve no money&mdash;no prospects. An&#8217; you want her
to exchange herself for <i>that</i>. Her that could marry a
millionaire if she wanted to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m&mdash;I&#8217;m willing that the engagement should be
a long one,&#8221; hesitated the boy, battling futilely against
the vulgar truth of Caleb&#8217;s words. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t ask
her to marry me till I was able to support her,&mdash;to
support her <i>well</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; in the meantime,&#8221; urged Conover, with merciless
logic. &#8220;In the meantime, she&#8217;s to have the
pleasure of sittin&#8217; by, eatin&#8217; her heart out, waitin&#8217;&mdash;waitin&#8217;&mdash;growin&#8217;
older ev&#8217;ry year,&mdash;losin&#8217; good
chances,&mdash;bein&#8217; side-tracked at parties an&#8217; so on, because
she&#8217;s engaged an&#8217; no longer in the marriage market,&mdash;waitin&#8217;
year after year&mdash;maybe till all her prettiness
an&#8217; her youth&#8217;s gone&mdash;just on the chance that
you&#8217;ll some day be able to support a wife? You
don&#8217;t mean to be crooked. You&#8217;re only just foolish.
But look the thing in the eyes an&#8217; tell me: Is it square?
Is it an honest bargain you offer? Aren&#8217;t you
cheatin&#8217; the one girl in the world you ought to do
most for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But with such an incentive,&#8221; pleaded the boy, &#8220;I&#8217;d
<i>surely</i> make my way quickly. In a year at most! I&#8217;d
work&mdash;I&#8217;d work so <i>hard</i> for her!&#8221;</p>

<p>Caleb leaned to one side and threw open the window<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
by his desk. With the warm, soft air of Spring
rushed in the steam sibilance and clangor of the railway
yards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look down there!&#8221; ordered Conover, pointing
out, &#8220;More&#8217;n a hundred men in that yard, ain&#8217;t
there? Dirty-faced men with stooped shoulders an&#8217;
soiled clothes. Not a one of &#8217;em that&#8217;s got a fam&#8217;ly
resemblance to Romeo. What are they doin&#8217;?
<i>Workin&#8217;!</i> Every mother&#8217;s son of &#8217;em workin&#8217; harder
than you or any of your fam&#8217;ly ever worked or ever
<i>could</i> work. How&#8217;d their faces get dirty an&#8217; stoopid
an&#8217; their shoulders bent over? By workin&#8217;. An&#8217; who
are they workin&#8217; for? For themselves? Not them.
Each one of &#8217;em&#8217;s workin&#8217; for some woman. An&#8217;
most of &#8217;em for a bunch of measly kids as well.
Workin&#8217; all day an&#8217; ev&#8217;ry day, till they drop dead or
wear out an&#8217; go to the poorhouse. An&#8217; the women
they work for are workin&#8217; too. Workin&#8217; at washboard
or scrub-brush to eke out the men-folks&#8217; an&#8217;
brats&#8217; livin&#8217;. Work! Work! Work! All their
lives. But I don&#8217;t see any of &#8217;em gatherin&#8217; in front of
the footlights an&#8217; singin&#8217; a chorus about how happy
they are, or how their hard work has made their wives
rich an&#8217; lazy. Are you any better&#8217;n they are? Can
you work any harder for Desir&eacute;e than <i>they</i> are workin&#8217;
for the slatternly, slab-sided, down-at-heel women at
home? Don&#8217;t you s&#8217;pose every one of those men
once planned to make his wife a lady an&#8217; to &#8216;cons&#8217;crate
his toil&#8217; to her? Think it over, son; an&#8217; get a better
argument than the silly fact that you&#8217;re willin&#8217; to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
your dooty by <i>workin&#8217;</i> for Desir&eacute;e. Hell&#8217;s full of
workers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It all seems so horrible&mdash;so gross&mdash;so material!&#8221;
muttered the boy. &#8220;But&mdash;but you&#8217;re right,
sir. I can see it now. Still&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stretched his hands out before him in an impulsive
gesture of despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; finished Caleb, &#8220;it hadn&#8217;t ought to be, hey?
Most things hadn&#8217;t. But most things are. Now look
here! I&#8217;ve wasted a lot of time an&#8217; a lot of bad tastin&#8217;
truths over you. I don&#8217;t know why I did it, except
that I always like to jaw after I&#8217;ve had a big fight on.
It kind of lets off steam. Here&#8217;s the answer in a nutshell:
I&#8217;m Miss Shevlin&#8217;s guardian. What Miss
Shevlin wants, she&#8217;s goin&#8217; to have, if I have to buy
the White House for her. If she wants you she can
have you. If she don&#8217;t want you&mdash;all the consent I
could give wouldn&#8217;t amount to a hoot in Hades.
Per&#8217;snally, I think you&#8217;d better wait till you grow up
an&#8217; get a job before you talk &#8217;bout marryin&#8217;. But it&#8217;s
her affair. Not mine. If she wants you she can have
you. Put it up to <i>her</i>. It&#8217;s past <i>me</i>. An&#8217; now trot
along. You&#8217;ve taken more of my time than you could
pay for in a dozen seven-page stories. Don&#8217;t stop to
thank me. Chase.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I do thank you a thousand times!&#8221; exclaimed
Hawarden, shaking hands with boyish vehemence.
&#8220;I&#8217;m&mdash;I&#8217;m awfully obliged to you. When I came, I
was afraid I&#8217;d meet some such fate as poor Mr. Blacarda.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; snapped Caleb, all geniality wiped
from his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;About Mr. Blacarda?&#8221; asked the boy in perfect
innocence. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you heard? It was in the
morning papers. It seems he was jumping on a moving
street car, up at the Capital, yesterday afternoon,
when his foot slipped on the steps and he was dragged
along, face-downward, for nearly half a block. Two
of his ribs were broken, and his body is covered with
bruises. The papers say his face is battered almost
beyond recognition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad!&#8221; remarked Conover drily. &#8220;Folks
ought to be careful how they try to jump onto heavy-movin&#8217;
things. Sometimes there&#8217;s apt to be a surprise
for the jumper. Now clear out! You can run an&#8217;
tell Dey what I said if you want to. No, don&#8217;t go
thankin&#8217; me again. It&#8217;s up to her, as I told you.
Most likely, she&#8217;ll send you about your business. So
long!&#8221;</p>

<p>Waving out the bewildered, delighted youth, Caleb
threw himself back in his leather chair and fished
from a case the ever-present cigar. A towering pile
of work lay untouched on his desk. But he gave it no
heed. With a queer, wholly inexplicable contraction
at the heart he lay there thinking. At first he tried
to laugh at the memory of the boy&#8217;s loftily worded pretensions.
But somehow he could not. He recalled
what Caine had said about Desir&eacute;e marrying &#8220;the
right man.&#8221; Hawarden came of good family. His
parents were among the best people in Granite. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
his wife, Desir&eacute;e could probably take and hold any
social position she chose. He was a nice boy, too.
And some day he would grow up. There was much
to be said for the match, preposterous as it had at first
seemed. After all, why not&mdash;?</p>

<p>A clerk entered with a card. Conover&#8217;s mouth set
in a grim smile as he glanced at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Send him in,&#8221; he said, moving across to his desk
chair, &#8220;I seem to be holdin&#8217; a levee of the ar&#8217;stocracy
this mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reuben Standish, gaunt, gray and stiff as ever, was
ushered into the private office. The old man&#8217;s face
was a monotone of drab, save for a ruddy patch on
either cheek bone where consumption flaunted a
no-surrender flag. Caleb greeted him with a nod and
motioned him to a seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope I have not broken in upon very important
work,&#8221; began Standish glancing at the mountain of
letters and papers on the desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;All my work&#8217;s important,&#8221; answered Caleb. &#8220;If
it wasn&#8217;t I&#8217;d have an office boy do it while I loafed.
Want anything especial?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First of all,&#8221; evaded Standish, in the courtly, old-world
manner that Caleb always found so jarring,
&#8220;permit me to congratulate you on your great victory
at the Capitol yesterday. I read this morning that
the Starke bill was defeated entirely through your
own personal endeavors. It must be a great thing to
wield so powerful an influence over one&#8217;s fellow men.
I&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>&#8220;Say,&#8221; interposed Caleb. &#8220;Quit standin&#8217; on the
distant hilltop makin&#8217; peace signs. Come on down an&#8217;
tell me what you want. Make it as short as you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>It appeared that Mr. Standish wanted much; though
he did not seem to be able to condense his wishes to
the degree Caleb suggested. This, however, was of
little account, since the Fighter already foreknew the
other&#8217;s mission. He listened with only perfunctory
attention to a recital of the Aaron Burr Bank&#8217;s needs,
of the stringency of deposits and the danger of a
&#8220;run;&#8221; with still less heed to the tale of an unwonted
depression in certain stocks wherein Mr. Standish&#8217;s
interest was purely marginal. As the story ended,
Conover said curtly:</p>

<p>&#8220;To sum it up, you&#8217;re broke. You want me to
make deposits to-day in your bank an&#8217; you want a
pers&#8217;nal loan besides.&#8221;</p>

<p>Standish started to speak. Caleb motioned back the
words.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;How much in all?
Don&#8217;t hem an&#8217; haw, man. You&#8217;ve got the amount
fixed in your mind, down to the last cent. You know
how much you&#8217;ll ask for, how much I&#8217;m li&#8217;ble to give
an&#8217; how much you really need. Start off with the
biggest sum first. How much?&#8221;</p>

<p>Standish tremulously blurted out his statement.
When one was dealing with a boor like this Conover,
there was surely no need for finesse. The fellow was
as blind to the finer shades of business dealings as to
the usages of gentle life. Therefore, why hesitate or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
leave him to guess the amount from adding up a series
of delicate hints? A low-browed boor; though a decidedly
convenient one to cultivate&mdash;at times. The
present being most emphatically one of these times,
Standish with ruffled dignity laid bare his financial
soul.</p>

<p>And the big, red-haired man lolled back in the opposite
chair watching his stately visitor from between
alert, half-shut eyes. The Fighter had waited,
worked, planned, for months, for this very interview.
Had Standish been better versed in sign-reading, he
might have seen marks of Conover&#8217;s passage all along
the tortuous finance trail that had at last led to this
private office and still more private confession.</p>

<p>But Standish had fallen not only into the trap but
into the fatal mistake that had, a century earlier, in
France, caused the severance of a goodly number of
noble heads:&mdash;the error of underestimating a proletariat
opponent. And now, unwittingly, he was about
to pay the price.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; observed Caleb, when the facts stood forth,
marshaled in their sorry array, &#8220;How does all this
int&#8217;rest <i>me</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon?&#8221; halted Standish.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, how does this int&#8217;rest <i>me</i>? Why should <i>I</i>
int&#8217;rest myself in doin&#8217; this mighty big favor for you?
Why don&#8217;t you turn to some of your own business
associates&mdash;some men of your own class? Why do
you come here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;you were so kind as to help me before&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>&#8220;An&#8217; that gives me a license to do it again?&#8221; suggested
Caleb. &#8220;That seems to be the rule all the
world over. The rest of your crowd are either as
bad off as you; or have too much sense to put cash into
a sinkin&#8217; enterprise, hey? So we come &#8217;a runnin&#8217; to
the easy mark, Caleb Conover. He&#8217;ll be flattered to
help us out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Conover!&#8221; coughed the poor old man.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; laughed Caleb. &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to
help you out. So don&#8217;t get any grayer in the face
than you are already. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to help you out for
two reasons. First, because if I don&#8217;t, you&#8217;re ruined.
Flat broke an&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Mr. Conover!&#8221; exclaimed Standish, tremblingly.
&#8220;Not in the very least. It is a temporary
crisis which&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which is goin&#8217; to become perm&#8217;nent unless I sling
out a life rope. What&#8217;s the use of lyin&#8217; &#8217;bout it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Standish laughed. The pitiful, mirthless laugh of
the man who is insulted and dare not resent the
affront; who compromises with trampled self-respect
by grinning where he should curse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good joke, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; agreed Caleb, reading the
broken aristocrat like an open page, &#8220;So much for
my first reason. My second reason for helpin&#8217; you
out is because I want to do you a neighborly turn.
We <i>are</i> neighbors, ain&#8217;t we, Standish?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why of course! Of course!&#8221; cried the other
wholly puzzled as to the trend of Caleb&#8217;s words; yet
unfeignedly happy&mdash;and therefore eager to be genial&mdash;over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
the solution of his financial tangle. He
coughed a pleasant acquiescence.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; went on Caleb, &#8220;it just occurs to me I ain&#8217;t
been as neighborly with you as I&#8217;d oughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Absent-mindedly, as he talked, Conover drew forth
his check book from a drawer and laid it open before
him, fingering its long pink slips.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he continued, forestalling Standish&#8217;s perplexed
reply, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t been so neighborly as I should.
You&#8217;ve been around here to see me several times, now.&mdash;An&#8217;
I&#8217;ve never once returned any of your visits.
It&#8217;s about up to me to come to see you. When&#8217;ll I
come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;by all means! By all means!&#8221; declared
Standish with effusion. &#8220;Come and lunch with me,
some day,&mdash;shall we say, at the Pompton Club?
Why not to-day? I shall be delighted. If&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t go out to lunch,&#8221; objected Conover.
&#8220;Haven&#8217;t time. But I&#8217;d be glad to eat dinner with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. Why, of course. Any evening you
say. The chef we have now at the Pompton Club&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to dine at the Pompton Club,&#8221; said
Caleb sulkily.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the Arareek, then. We&#8217;re both members there.
What evening&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor the Arareek, neither,&#8221; answered Caleb,
&#8220;Eatin&#8217; food with a man at his club ain&#8217;t what I call
bein&#8217; neighborly. I&#8217;ll just drop around on you for a
home dinner some evenin&#8217;. I&#8217;ll like that better.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>&#8220;Why, ye&mdash;es,&#8221; coincided Standish, with all the
cordiality he could muster against the shock, &#8220;That
will be delightful. Certainly. Some evening
when&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d Friday evenin&#8217; of this week suit you?&#8221;
asked Caleb, breaking in on the loosely strung speech
of his guest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Friday?&#8221; echoed Standish, taken aback. &#8220;Why,
why my family are to be at home that evening!&#8221;</p>

<p>White spots leaped into view at either side of Caleb&#8217;s
close shut lips, and something lurid flamed far back
in his eyes. Had Blacarda&mdash;in his hospital room
at the Capital&mdash;seen that look, he might have suffered
relapse. But Standish was near-sighted,&mdash;except
in the eyes,&mdash;and the expression passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know your fam&#8217;ly&#8217;s to be home that night,&#8221; said
Conover in a curiously muffled voice. &#8220;Also there&#8217;s
a dinner party you&#8217;re givin&#8217;. An&#8217; a musicle afterward.
Twelve guests to the dinner. &#8217;Bout two hundred
to the musicle. I&#8217;m comin&#8217; to both.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But my dear Mr. Conover!&#8221; cried Standish with
forced gaiety. &#8220;You don&#8217;t quite see the point&mdash;Much
as I&mdash;and all of us&mdash;would be delighted to
have you as our guest at dinner that night, yet the
laws of a dinner party are unpleasantly&mdash;perhaps
ridiculously&mdash;rigid. For instance, this is to be a
dinner for twelve. An extra man would spoil the
balance&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221; with sudden inspiration&mdash;&#8220;it
would make thirteen. So many people are foolishly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
superstitious! I confess, I am, for one. Now the
next evening would&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The next evenin&#8217;,&#8221; said Conover, &#8220;you an&#8217; your
fam&#8217;ly are booked for the Hawarden&#8217;s theatre party.
I read about it in the <i>Star</i>. You&#8217;d excuse yourself an&#8217;
stay at home an&#8217; dine alone with me. An&#8217; that&#8217;d be
about as merry as a morgue for both of us. No,
I&#8217;m comin&#8217; Friday;&mdash;if you&#8217;ll be so good as to ask me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve just told you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve just told me there was to be twelve guests.
That&#8217;s all right. There&#8217;ll be only twelve. I&#8217;ll be one
of the twelve. Blacarda was invited. He&#8217;s laid up in
the hospital from a car acc&#8217;dent an&#8217; can&#8217;t come. I&#8217;m
helpin&#8217; you out by takin&#8217; his place. No inconvenience
to anyone. Unless maybe you think your daughter
an&#8217; your sister-in-law won&#8217;t care to meet me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all! Nonsense!&#8221; fumed Standish, in fearful
straits. &#8220;They&#8217;d be very glad indeed. But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then that&#8217;s settled,&#8221; decided Conover.
&#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bent over the check book, pen in hand. Standish,
at his wit&#8217;s end, made one more attempt to drag
himself free of the dilemma.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you won&#8217;t be offended,&#8221; he faltered, with
another dry cough, &#8220;if I say frankly,&mdash;frankness is
always best, I think,&mdash;that I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Caleb closed the check book with a snap and
whirled his desk chair about, to face his visitor; so
suddenly that the latter involuntarily started back.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
Not even Standish could now misread that dull, hot
glint in Conover&#8217;s pale eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Mr. Standish,&#8221; said the Fighter.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t ever make the blunder of thinkin&#8217; a man can&#8217;t
understand you just because you can&#8217;t understand him.
If you&#8217;d said to one of your own crowd: &#8216;I can&#8217;t invite
you to my house because my fam&#8217;ly&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be
there; because you ain&#8217;t fit to meet my women,&#8217;&mdash;if
you&#8217;d said that to one of them, he&#8217;d a&#8217; been your
enemy for life. You wouldn&#8217;t a&#8217;dared insult him so.
But you said it to me because you thought I wouldn&#8217;t
understand. Well, I do. Shut up! I know what
you want to say, an&#8217; I don&#8217;t want to hear it. I&#8217;m
not comin&#8217; to your house for love of <i>you</i>; but I&#8217;m
comin&#8217; just the same&mdash;I guess I&#8217;ve bought my right
to. If a man&#8217;s good enough to beg from, he&#8217;s good
enough to treat civil. An&#8217; you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to treat <i>me</i>
civil. This afternoon I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to get an invite to
your dinner an&#8217; the musicle. You ought to be grateful
that I don&#8217;t insist on singin&#8217; there. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; on
Friday, an&#8217; you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to pass the word around that
I&#8217;m to be treated right, while I&#8217;m there. Just to make
sure of it, I&#8217;ll date this check ahead to next Saturday.&#8221;</p>

<p>A last remnant of manhood flared up within the
consumptive old bank president&#8217;s withered soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not to be bulldozed, Mr. Conover!&#8221; he said
with a certain dignity. &#8220;Because you extend business
favors to me, I am not obliged to admit a man of your
character to my home. And I shall not. As for the
loan&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>&#8220;As for the loan,&#8221; replied Conover, shrugging his
shoulders, and tossing the check book back in the
drawer, &#8220;I&#8217;m not obliged to stave off ruin from a
man that thinks I&#8217;m not fit to enter his home. That&#8217;s
all. Good-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>He slammed shut the desk drawer, and began to
look over some of the opened letters before him.</p>

<p>The old man had risen to his feet, his eyes fixed on
the closed drawer like those of a starved dog on a
chunk of meat. His mouth-corners twitched and
humiliation forced an unwonted moisture into his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Conover,&#8221; he began, tentatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-day!&#8221; retorted Caleb without raising his
eyes from the papers he was sorting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Conover!&#8221; coughed Standish in despair, &#8220;I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll
be very glad if you&#8217;ll dine with us on Friday
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Conover opened the drawer, tossed the check across
the table and went on with his work.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be there,&#8221; he grunted.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>A LESSON IN IGNORANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Desir&eacute;e was at the piano. Caleb Conover, whose
knowledge of music embraced one Sousa march and
&#8220;Summer Noon&#8221; (with a somewhat hazy idea as to
which was which) lounged, sprawling, on a cushion by
her feet; listening in ignorant admiration to the
snatches of melody. That anyone could coax a tune
out of so complex an instrument was to him a mystery
to be greeted with silent respect.</p>

<p>He had come to her, in the long Spring twilight, to
show with naive pride an invitation he had just received.
An invitation to the musicale-dinner at the
Standishes&#8217;, three nights hence. He volunteered no
information as to how it had been obtained; but evaded
the girl&#8217;s wondering queries with the guilty embarrassment
that was always his when she chanced to
corner him in a fault. From Conover&#8217;s manner Desir&eacute;e
gathered that the invitation was in a way an
effort on Standish&#8217;s part to repay the courtesy of the
various large loans she knew Caleb had made to the
banker. Nor would she spoil the Fighter&#8217;s very evident
delight by closer cross-questioning. Caleb had
said, days ago, that he was going to be invited to the
dinner. And, despite her invariable scoffs at his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
boasts, she had long since learned that such vaunts had
an odd way of coming true.</p>

<p>The June dusk lay velvet-like over the little music
room. From the yard outside came the bitter-sweet
breath of syringas. Far off sounded the yells of Billy
Shevlin and some of his fellow street-boys; their
racket mellowed by distance.</p>

<p>Talk had languished. At last Desir&eacute;e had crossed
to the piano. She sat, playing scraps of music, as was
her wont; pausing now and then to speak; then letting
her fingers run into a new air or a series of soft improvised
chords. She had scant technique and played
almost wholly by ear; using the piano only as the amateur
music-worshipper&#8217;s medium for recalling and reproducing
some cherished fragments of song.</p>

<p>But to Caleb, lolling at her side, the performance
was sublime. That anyone could talk while playing
the piano was to him nothing short of marvelous.
He was firmly convinced it was a gift vouchsafed to
Desir&eacute;e alone. Music itself was wholly unintelligible
to him. Except from Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s lips or fingers, he
found it actively distasteful. But all she did was perfect.
And if her playing fell upon his ear as a meaningless
jumble of sounds, he at least found the sounds
sweet.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that thing you just did with one hand and
then rumbled down on the low notes with the other?&#8221;
he asked, after a spell of watching the busy white
fingers shining through the dusk.</p>

<p>&#8220;That?&#8221; queried Desir&eacute;e. &#8220;It&#8217;s just the Vanderdecken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
motive from <i>The Flying Dutchman</i>. And I
used to be able to play the whole Spinning Song; but
I&#8217;ve forgotten most of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; murmured Caleb, who found her words as
unmeaning as her music. &#8220;I <i>thought</i> I remembered
that one. &#8216;Spinning Song,&#8217; hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said absently. &#8220;It starts out with lots
of bizzy, purry little notes too fast for me to play. I
never could learn the piano.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet you could!&#8221; cried Caleb, at once afire
with contradiction. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard a lot of crackajack
piano players an&#8217; never one of &#8217;em could hold a candle
to you. Why, there was Blink Snesham&mdash;the feller
they called Ragtime King,&mdash;down to Kerrigan&#8217;s.
You&#8217;ve got him beat a block.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You dear old loyal idiot!&#8221; laughed Desir&eacute;e, lifting
one hand from the keys to rumple his stiff red hair
with a gesture as affectionate as it was discomfiting.
&#8220;I believe you think I&#8217;m the wonderfullest person on
earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>know</i> you are,&#8221; he answered simply, his big
body a-thrill with half-holy joy at her touch.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the one you&#8217;re playing now with your other
hand. Ain&#8217;t so very long, but it&#8217;s kind of sprightly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Siegfried&#8217;s horn-call. See how it changes to
four-time and loses all its buoyancy, in the <i>Goetterdaemmerung</i>
funeral march.&#8221;</p>

<p>Solemnly, hopelessly, the transformed, distorted
horn-call crashed out.</p>

<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t the same thing you played just now, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
it?&#8221; he asked in doubt. &#8220;Sounds sort of like the
toons the bands play at Masonic fun&#8217;rals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same notes. Different tempo. One is the motive
of the boy who starts out through the forest of life
sounding a joy-challenge to everything and everybody.
The other is woven into the dead hero&#8217;s mourning
chant. In <i>Goetterdaemmerung</i>, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. I remember now,&#8221; said Caleb, hastily.
&#8220;It&#8217;d just slipped my mind for the minute. I&#8217;ve got
so many things to think of, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Caleb Conover!&#8221;</p>

<p>Down came both little hands with a reproving bang
on the keyboard, as the girl started out of her rhapsody.</p>

<p>&#8220;Caleb Conover, you&#8217;re being that way <i>again</i>! And
after all I&#8217;ve told you. How am I going to cure you
of pretending?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Dey!&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Honest I&mdash;I thought&mdash;I
did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know very well you were pretending. You
don&#8217;t know whether <i>Goetterdaemmerung</i> is a dog, a
bird, or a patent medicine. Now confess. <i>Do</i> you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the sound,&#8221; floundered Caleb, in all seriousness,
&#8220;I&#8217;d put my money on the dog. But then, maybe&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Desir&eacute;e leaned back and laughed long and delightedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>Caleb</i>!&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;<i>What</i> am I going to
do with you? Are you never going to grow up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so long as my making a fool of myself can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
get such a sweet-sounding laugh out of you,&#8221; he returned.
&#8220;But, honest, Dey, how can you expect me
to know them things about horns an&#8217; Dutchmen an&#8217;
spinnin&#8217;, an&#8217; all that, when you never tell me beforehand
what it is you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to play? When you&#8217;re
doin&#8217; those piano stunts, I always feel like you was
travelin&#8217; through places where the &#8216;No Thoroughfare&#8217;
sign&#8217;s hung out for <i>me</i>. Then when I make b&#8217;lieve
I&#8217;m keepin&#8217; up with you,&mdash;just so as I won&#8217;t get to
feelin&#8217; too lonesome,&mdash;you find it out somehow an&#8217;
call me down. What&#8217;s that thing you&#8217;re playin&#8217;
<i>now</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>Infinitely sweet, fraught with all the tender hopelessness
of parting, the notes sobbed out into the little
room; then stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all I know of it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I only heard
it once. In New York, winter before last. It&#8217;s the
third act duet between Mimi and Rodolfo in &#8216;<i>Boh&eacute;me</i>.&#8217;
Where they say goodbye in the snow, at the
Paris barrier. I wish I remembered the rest of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I thought those people was in the <i>play</i> you
told me about. You see I <i>do</i> remember some things
like that. Weren&#8217;t they the ones that was in love an&#8217;
the feller said the girl was his &#8216;Youth,&#8217; an&#8217; when she
died&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s an opera with the same sort of story.
It&#8217;s queer you remember it. That&#8217;s the second time
you&#8217;ve spoken to me about &#8216;<i>La Vie de Boh&eacute;me</i>&#8217;.
How funny that a big, matter-of-fact business man
like you should be interested in sentimental stories of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
Youth and Love and Death! Come!&#8221; rising from
the music stool and losing the unwonted dreaminess
that had stolen over her, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to talk to you
now about the Standishes&#8217; dinner. Have you <i>any</i> idea
how to behave, or what to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; drawled Caleb, &#8220;I guess it&#8217;s mor&#8217;n three
years now since you loored me from the simple
Jeffersonian joys of eatin&#8217; with my knife. An&#8217; I know
&#8217;bout not tuckin&#8217; my napkin under my chin, an&#8217; not
makin&#8217; noises like a swimmin&#8217; pool while I&#8217;m eatin&#8217;
soup. An&#8217;&mdash;an I mustn&#8217;t touch the butter with my
fork. You see I&#8217;ve learnt a lot by your lettin&#8217; me
come here to dinner so often. I guess there ain&#8217;t any
more things to remember, are there? The part about
the butter will be hardest, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There won&#8217;t be any butter,&#8221; said Desir&eacute;e, &#8220;So
there&#8217;s one less temptation for you to grapple with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll be all right about the eatin&#8217;,&#8221; replied
Conover. &#8220;Knife, soup, napkin, butter. Anything
else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only about fifty more things,&#8221; answered Desir&eacute;e,
pessimistically. &#8220;Oh, I do wish I were to be there to
coach you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Want an invitation?&#8221; asked Caleb, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How silly! At the eleventh hour? Of course I
don&#8217;t. I hardly know them. Besides I&#8217;m going to
the musicale afterward. But I&#8217;m <i>so</i> afraid you&#8217;ll do
something you ought not to. You won&#8217;t, <i>will</i> you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most likely I will,&#8221; confessed Caleb, ruefully.
&#8220;But I bought a book to-day &#8217;bout etiquette an&#8217; I&#8217;m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
reading up a little. I&#8217;ve got one or two pointers already.
Napkins are servy&mdash;serv&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Serviettes?&#8221; suggested Desir&eacute;e. &#8220;But no one
nowadays calls them&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; when you don&#8217;t want to get jagged, put your
hand, &#8216;with a careless, debbynair movement,&#8217;&#8221; he
quoted, &#8220;&#8216;Over the top of whichever glass the serv&#8217;nt
is offerin&#8217; to fill.&#8217; How&#8217;s that?&#8221; he ended with pride.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll sit up with that measly book ev&#8217;ry night till
Friday. By that time I&#8217;ll be&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be so tangled up you won&#8217;t know whether
your soup-plate is for oysters or coffee,&#8221; she interrupted.
&#8220;Now listen to me: I&#8217;m going to crowd
into one inspired lecture all I can think of about dinner
etiquette and other social chores, for you to use that
evening. And when you go home, burn that book
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>She forthwith launched upon a disquisition of such
difficulties as lay before him on his debut as a diner,
and how each might be bridged. After the first few
sentences, Caleb&#8217;s attention strayed from her words to
her voice. Its sweetness, its youth and a peculiar child-like
quality in it always fascinated him. Now, with
the added didactic touch, bred of the lesson she was
seeking to teach, he found it altogether wonderful.</p>

<p>Listening with rapt, almost worshipping attention,
yet noting no word, the giant sat huddled up in an
awkward, happy bunch at the feet of the youthful
Gamaliel. A bar of lamplight from the opposite side
of the street filtered through the swaying window<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
curtains, bringing her half-hidden head with its dusky
crown of hair into vague relief. From under the
shadowy brows, her great eyes glowed in the dim
light. Her dainty, flower face was very earnest.
Caleb felt an almost irresistible desire to pass his great,
rough palm gently over her features; to catch and kiss
one of those tiny, earnestly gesturing hands of hers.
She was so little, so young, so pretty. And she
wasting all that loveliness on <i>him</i>, when she might be
fascinating some eligible man. The thought reminded
Caleb of his interview with Jack Hawarden. Curious
to learn how the lad had availed himself of the permission
to woo Desir&eacute;e, Conover broke in at her next
pause, with the abrupt question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Young Hawarden been here to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; said Desir&eacute;e in surprise, &#8220;This noon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask you to marry him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He told you?&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Beforehand. Didn&#8217;t he say I&#8217;d gave him
leave? No? Well, I s&#8217;pose he wouldn&#8217;t be likely to.
But I did. Sent him on, to try his luck. With my
blessin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? Did that foolish boy&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Came like a little man an&#8217; asked my permission,
as your guardian, to make a proposal to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you told him he could? <i>What</i> business was
it of yours, I&#8217;d like to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him it wasn&#8217;t any business of mine.
That&#8217;s why I let him come. If it was <i>my</i> business, I&#8217;d
have you shut up in a big place with walls all around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
it; an&#8217; kittens an&#8217; canary birds an&#8217; all sorts of fluffy
things for you to play with. An&#8217; no man but me
should ever come within a hundred miles of you.
Then there&#8217;d be no danger of your runnin&#8217; off an&#8217;
gettin&#8217; married to some geezer who&#8217;d teach you to
think I was the sort of man that ought to be fed in
the kitchen an&#8217; never &#8217;lowed in the parlor. Oh, I
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl was looking at him with big, inscrutable
eyes, as he halted half-ashamed of his own words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; she said slowly, after a little pause, &#8220;I
think you must have inherited a great, <i>great</i> deal of
ignorance, Caleb. For during the years while you
were a baby, you were too young to acquire <i>very</i> much
of it. And you <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> have acquired all your present
stock in the thirty short years since that time.
Besides, I don&#8217;t think even Nature can make a man
<i>quite</i> foolish unless he helps her a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It sounds fine,&#8221; admitted Caleb, &#8220;But what does
it mean? What break have I made now? If it was
foolish to want you all to myself, always&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; she interrupted, &#8220;And you ought to
know it wasn&#8217;t. It&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Caine,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;told me once you were
the cleverest man he knew. It made me very happy
at the time. And I was nice to him all the rest of the
afternoon. But I see now it only showed how few
sensible men he knew. Let&#8217;s talk about something
else.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>&#8220;But&mdash;hold on!&#8221; begged Caleb. &#8220;Honest, Dey,
you ought to think twice before turnin&#8217; down a chap
like young Hawarden. His fam&#8217;ly&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you last week never to talk that way again,&#8221;
said Desir&eacute;e, with a stifled break in her voice, &#8220;<i>Why</i>
do you try to make me unhappy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Me?</i>&#8221; gurgled Caleb in an utter bewilderment of
distress. &#8220;Why, little girl, I&#8217;d cut my head off for
you. Please don&#8217;t get sore on me. I&#8217;m no sort of
a feller to talk to a girl like you. I&#8217;m always sayin&#8217;
the wrong thing without even knowin&#8217; afterward just
what it was that hurt you. An&#8217; then I wish I had
a third foot, so&#8217;s I could kick myself. It&#8217;s queer that
Nature built men so that they couldn&#8217;t kick themselves
or pat themselves on the back. <i>Please</i> be friends
again. I&mdash;I wish there was some tea here I could
drink, just to show you how sorry I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s mood had changed. She laughed with
such heartiness at his penitential attitude that he all
at once felt full forgiveness was granted. If there
was a forced note in her gaiety, his duller senses did
not perceive it.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Absolvo te!</i>&#8221; she intoned. &#8220;I&#8217;m a little cat ever
to scratch you; and I&#8217;m silly to let perfectly harmless
things hurt me. I don&#8217;t know why I do it. Sometimes
I don&#8217;t know my own self any more than if I was
a Frisian market woman in a pink baize bonnet and
number ten sabots. It&#8217;s just because you&#8217;re so good
and sweet and gentle that I walk all over you. Because
you let me do it I take out all my bad, horrid,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
nasty tempers on you. And then you look so surprised
and unhappy when I say snippy, mean things
to you; or when I tell you you make me feel badly and&mdash;oh
<i>where</i> is my nominative case? Anyway, you&#8217;re
my dear, old splendid chum. And I wouldn&#8217;t be so
cranky to you if I didn&#8217;t care more for your little
finger than for any other man&#8217;s head. And if you&#8217;d
only hit me or swear at me now and then, I&#8217;d be <i>lots</i>
nicer. Why don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Caleb, agape, yet grinning in feeble delight, tried
to understand part of this rapid-fire speech of penance.
Almost wholly failing to grasp her meaning, he
nevertheless gathered that he was pardoned for his
unknown offence and that she was once more happy.
Hence the weight was off his mind and he rejoiced.</p>

<p>&#8220;And just to punish myself,&#8221; Desir&eacute;e was saying,
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell you about Jack Hawarden. He
came here and asked me to marry him. And I told
him he was an awfully nice boy. And I felt I was
unkind and cruel and a lot of other things because I
had to tell him I wasn&#8217;t in love with him. But he
behaved beautifully. He&#8217;s going to keep on coming
to see me, just the same and we&#8217;re going to be just
as good friends as ever. But he says he isn&#8217;t going
to give up trying to make me change my mind. Then
I changed the subject by making him listen to Siegfried-Mickey
singing &#8216;The Death of Ase.&#8217; And
from that I got him to talking about the things he&#8217;s
writing. He says he believes some day his stories
will sell like wild-fire. If you&#8217;ve never tried to sell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
wild-fire you can&#8217;t appreciate what an eager market
there is for it. I told him that and he didn&#8217;t like it
very well. But altogether I steered him off from
talking about marrying me. So the rest didn&#8217;t matter
very much. <i>Did</i> it? Are you <i>sure</i> you can remember
all the things I explained to you about that dinner?
At the musicale itself I shall try to get a chance to
take you under my own wing, and keep you from
burning your poor fingers. But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you think I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to queer you, at the
musicle, by taggin&#8217; around after you, you&#8217;re dead
wrong,&#8221; declared Caleb. &#8220;You get &#8217;bout as much
of me as you need, here at your own house; without
havin&#8217; me scarin&#8217; better men away from you at parties.
No, no. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to set in a corner an&#8217; watch folks
fallin&#8217; over &#8217;emselves to talk to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You big boy!&#8221; she scoffed, tenderly. &#8220;In the
first place, people sit up stiffly, without talking, while
the music is going on,&mdash;at least they&#8217;re supposed to.
In the second, don&#8217;t think just because <i>you&#8217;re</i> foolish
enough to like being with me, that other people will.
I don&#8217;t think there will be any <i>very</i> tumultuous applause
when I enter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be the hit of the evenin&#8217; as far as <i>I&#8217;m</i>
concerned,&#8221; stoutly averred Caleb. &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; out
to the Arareek Club in a few minutes,&#8221; he went on,
glancing at his watch. &#8220;There&#8217;s a dinner given to the
golf champion or middleweight tattin&#8217;-work-expert or
some such c&#8217;lebrity. I&#8217;m going to drop in for the
speeches. It&#8217;ll be my first appearance there since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
they didn&#8217;t kick me out. Caine&#8217;s goin&#8217; too; for the
speeches. Him an&#8217; Miss Standish, I b&#8217;lieve. Won&#8217;t
you come along?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; lamented the girl. &#8220;Mrs. Cole and her
sister from Denver are coming in to see Aunt Mary.
They&#8217;ll want to play whist. They always do. And I
promised Aunt Mary I&#8217;d stay and make out the four.
Whist is such a jolly game, I think,&mdash;for people that
like it. <i>I</i> hate it. But I&#8217;d be a splendid player, Aunt
Mary says, if I could ever remember what cards are
out. So I&#8217;m in for a happy, happy evening. I wish
they could ask the cook to play instead. Oh, dear!
Why does one always feel so horrid when one is doing
people a good turn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; volunteered Caleb. &#8220;I never
tried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never tried!&#8221; echoed Desir&eacute;e. &#8220;<i>Why</i> will you
talk such nonsense? You know you&#8217;re <i>always</i> doing
things for people. Why, the paper said yesterday
that you missed your train back from the Capital, just
to take Mr. Blacarda to the hospital after he was so
terribly hurt in the accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Caleb, magnanimously, &#8220;That was only
because I felt kind of sorry for the poor feller.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>IN THE HOUSE OF RIMMON</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Conover swung down the hill toward the valley in
whose centre twinkled the lights of the Arareek Country
Club. He was still buoyed up by the curious
elation that was always his after an hour with Desir&eacute;e.
For perhaps the first time in his life the thousand soft
odors of the June dusk carried for him a meaning; and
in every nerve he was aware of the mild glory of the
night. He took deep breaths of the scented air and
squared his mighty shoulders as he strode down the
slope. It was good to be alive; to feel the easy play
of one&#8217;s perfect muscles; to be tireless, victorious, and
still in the early thirties.</p>

<p>A girl in a white dress was walking a short distance
ahead of him as he neared the Clubhouse. Each long
step brought Conover nearer to her. At her side
walked a man. The couple were in no haste, but
seemed bent on enjoying the beauty of the night in
leisurely fashion before reaching their destination. As
Caleb came alongside, a few rods from the Arareek
gates, the man hailed him. It was Caine. Conover,
barely remembering himself in time to imitate the
other&#8217;s salute, pulled off his hat and slouched toward
the two.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>&#8220;Miss Standish,&#8221; said Caine, after greeting the
Fighter, &#8220;May I present Mr. Conover?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl held out her hand shyly. Caleb, as he
took it, looked down at her with considerable interest.
He was curious to see what manner of woman the
fastidious Caine had so long idolized; and to whom,
in face of much rumored family opposition, he had
recently become engaged. The lights of the open
Clubhouse door shone full upon Letty Standish, and
Caleb&#8217;s first curiosity changed to something like
astonishment. She was a plump little creature, with
a pretty, slack face. Caleb, versed in reading
physiognomy, saw in her upturned countenance much
amiability,&mdash;of the sort that tends to turn gently sub-acid
under the right provocation,&mdash;a charmingly, complete
lack of any sort of resolution; and an intellect as
profound as that of an unusually sagacious guinea
pig. Large, delft-blue eyes, a quivering button of a
nose, a pouting little mouth; profuse light brown hair
piled high above a narrow forehead. Pretty with the
inherent comeliness of extreme youth, but&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like a measly rabbit!&#8221; thought Conover in
amused contempt, &#8220;An&#8217; <i>that&#8217;s</i> what Amzi Nicholas
Caine&#8217;s been workin&#8217; all his life to win, is it? Gee,
but it&#8217;s queer what kinks a sane man&#8217;s brain&#8217;ll take,
where a woman&#8217;s concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>Outwardly he was listening with stony immobility
to Letty&#8217;s timid words of salutation. As she paused,
he pulled his wits together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pleased to meet you,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;m to have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
pleasure of takin&#8217; dinner at your house Friday night, I
b&#8217;lieve. Thanks for askin&#8217; me. I hope we&#8217;ll see more
of each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My aunt and I are always glad to meet Father&#8217;s
business friends,&#8221; returned Letty, ill at ease. She
had wondered, and her aunt had protested loudly, at
Standish&#8217;s curt announcement that Blacarda&#8217;s vacated
place at the table must be taken by this unknown outsider.
Nor, as she looked at the stocky, heavy-jowled
man and heard his uncouth speech, did the mystery
grow clearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seemed in a hurry,&#8221; observed Caine, relieving
the girl&#8217;s embarrassment by taking Conover off
her hands, &#8220;I think we&#8217;ll be in plenty of time to hear
all of the speeches we care to. There&#8217;s the same
pleasing likeness about them that there is about a string
of street cars. If you miss one, you can get the next
and nothing worth while is lost by the omission. At
stag dinners of course it&#8217;s different. Then it is
always interesting to note the inverse ratio between
eloquence and sobriety. But at these &#8216;Celebration&#8217;
dinners the speeches are warranted to contain nothing
of dangerous interest. Shall we go in?&#8221;</p>

<p>For lack of a gallery, the guests who had come to
hear the speeches, sat in the double ranks of chairs
which lined the large dining room. Conover and the
two others arrived during a momentary lull between
speeches. Letty was greeted cordially by such people
as she passed on her way to her seat. Caleb, as
one of her escort, found himself the object of more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
courtesy than had ever before been his portion at the
Arareek.</p>

<p>This new warmth of manner on the part of his
fellow-members pleased Caleb tremendously. Incidentally,
it gave him the germ of an idea,&mdash;vague,
nebulous, yet of promising growth. The burgeoning
germ found mental expression during the next after-dinner
speech. Caleb allowed his shrewd gaze to rest
on Letty Standish, more critically&mdash;with less of humorous
depreciation&mdash;than before. She sat next him,
one plump hand pillowing her slightly receding chin;
her wide blue eyes fixed on the speaker in polite attention;
her small mouth pursed in a smile of almost
labored interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s better-lookin&#8217; than I thought,&#8221; mused Conover,
&#8220;An&#8217; she&#8217;s a good dresser. Maybe her face
ain&#8217;t really so foolish. Starin&#8217; at Dey so much may
have spoiled me for other girls. Everybody here
seems glad to see this Standish person; an&#8217; some of
their gladness has slopped over onto me. If I&#8217;d a
wife like that I&#8217;d strut right into the gold-shirt crowd
an&#8217; they&#8217;d hang up a &#8216;Welcome, Little Stranger!&#8217; sign
for me. If Dey can get into the right set by marryin&#8217;
one of &#8217;em, I guess the same rule ought to work with
me. I&#8217;ll talk it over sometime with Caine. He ought
to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>A ripple of hand-clapping roused Caleb from his
disjointed reflections, and he joined with vigor in applauding
the speech he had not heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;What an easy speaker Mr. Vroom is!&#8221; said Letty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you envy such men, Mr. Conover? Don&#8217;t you
think it must be wonderful to make a speech without
being frightened to death? To stand up before so
many people and just talk to them as if&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easiest thing in the world!&#8221; announced Caleb,
dully irritated at her praise, &#8220;Anyone can do it. All
a man needs is to say to himself: &#8216;I&#8217;m a blame sight
better, cleverer, bigger man than any of this bunch
I&#8217;m talkin&#8217; down to.&#8217; <i>Then</i> he won&#8217;t be afraid of &#8217;em.
Because he despises &#8217;em. That&#8217;s the way <i>I</i> always do
when I&#8217;ve got a speech to make. It&#8217;s lots easier to
stand up in an open-face suit an&#8217; talk like Vroom did
to a friendly crowd, than to try and persuade one
grouchy grocer to handle your special brand of washin&#8217;
soda. <i>There&#8217;s</i> where reel el&#8217;quence comes in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; rejoined Letty, with her wavering little
smile. &#8220;How clever of you to put it in such an
original way! I never thought of that, before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of what?&#8221; demanded Caleb, inquisitorially.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of&mdash;of&mdash;why, of what you said, of course.
Now, shan&#8217;t we listen to the toastmaster? He&#8217;s always
so funny, I think. Do you know him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Caleb. &#8220;He&#8217;s a novelty to me.
But we&#8217;ll listen if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>He folded his arms, leaned back in his camp chair
and turned a look of ponderous gravity upon the toastmaster.
The latter, swaying back and forth on his
toes, his hands in his pockets, was lengthily introducing
the next speaker. At every third sentence his
eye would sweep the room with a roguish twinkle as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
who should say: &#8220;Make ready now for the newest of
my irresistible quips!&#8221; And the listeners would obediently
prepare to roar. Letty&#8217;s pleasant giggle at
each sally annoyed Caleb. He could not say why.
But involuntarily he glanced toward her with a frown.
She chanced to be looking at him, at the same moment,
for companionship in her appreciation of the
latest witticism. Meeting the scowl, her nose quivered
and her smile froze into pitiful, half-appealing
lines that added to Caleb&#8217;s senseless irritation. But,
by an effort, he sought awkwardly to nullify any unpleasant
impression of him that she might have gained.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that joke?&#8221; he whispered, to explain
his frown. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t quite catch it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; faltered Letty, &#8220;he said&mdash;he said&mdash;&#8216;the
man who hesitates, foozles.&#8217; I <i>think</i> that was it.
Something like that. Or,&mdash;was it&mdash;&#8216;the man
who&mdash;&#8217;? Oh, listen! He&#8217;s going to tell that lovely
story about the minister who had to give up golf or
the pulpit. I do want to hear that!&#8221;</p>

<p>The murmur of joyous anticipation, as the toastmaster
hoisted preliminary warnings for this classic,
showed that Letty was by no means unique in her
choice of rechauff&egrave;e humor. Caleb sat glum under the
salvo of merriment. Letty glanced sideways, in dawning
uneasiness, at his set face.</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; beamed the toastmaster, &#8220;as the Irish caddie
said to the&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The door leading from the butler&#8217;s pantry burst
open. Through the aperture into the bright-lit dining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
hall scurried a red-faced, bald-headed man; two club
servants close at his heels. The fugitive was clad in
a soiled waiter-jacket and a pair of patched overalls.
Both garments had evidently been intended for someone
much larger. Their present wearer seemed lost
in their voluminous folds. Yet, even thus hampered,
he dodged his pursuers with an agility little short of
incredible in so old a man.</p>

<p>Darting forward into the full blaze of light, he fled
around the table. The two servants had checked their
pursuit near the door; and now stood irresolute, at a
loss whether or not to continue the chase into the
sacred precincts of the dining room. They looked for
instructions to a stout, pompous personage who, following
them up from the pantry, now blocked the
doorway and stared balefully at the little old man.
The latter in his flight had come into violent contact
with one of the slender pillars near the toastmaster&#8217;s
chair. Wrapping both arms about this, he slid to the
floor and crouched there; still clinging to the pillar;
making horrible simian faces over his shoulder at the
trio beside the pantry door.</p>

<p>At the apparition, several diners had jumped excitedly
to their feet, (with the world-old instinct which
taught prehistoric man to meet danger or surprise,
standing); others had craned their necks or shouted
confused queries. One woman had cried out. Every
eye in the room was upon the grotesque, couchant little
figure huddled against the centre pillar. The toastmaster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
turned in lofty severity upon the big man in the
doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steward!&#8221; he declaimed. &#8220;What does this
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I am extremely sorry, Mr. Dillingham!&#8221; answered
the steward, venturing forward. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure
I apologize most sincerely. I wouldn&#8217;t have had
such a thing happen for worlds. We were short of
men in the kitchen, to-night, sir. That&mdash;that old
panhandler over there, sir,&#8221; pointing an abhorring finger
at the refugee, &#8220;came around looking for an odd
job. So I set him to washing dishes. He said he&#8217;d
stopped off a train on his way from the West. He
got at some of the wines, sir, when we wasn&#8217;t looking.
He&#8217;s in a disgusting state, sir. Then one of my men
caught him pocketing some forks and I told two of
the waiters to search him and send for the police.
They grabbed him, but he slipped away and ran in
here. So I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do! That will <i>do</i>!&#8221; thundered the
toastmaster, succeeding, after divers trials, in breaking
in upon the narrative. &#8220;Remove him. At once!
And as quietly as you can.&mdash;I am more sorry than I
can say,&#8221; he went on urbanely, addressing the guests,
&#8220;that such a disgraceful scene should have&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A howl from the man on the floor cut short the
apology. Two servants had approached to do the
toastmaster&#8217;s bidding. As the first of them seized him
by the shoulder the little man screamed like a mad cat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
Locking his legs about the pillar, he turned upon his
assailants with fists and teeth, fighting with the deadly,
unscientific fury of a cornered wild thing. The scrimmage
that followed set the room in dire confusion.
To end which, the toastmaster so far unbent as to rush
among the combatants and order back his myrmidons.
The attendants drew away, disheveled, bleeding,
robbed of the spruce neatness that was the Arareek&#8217;s
pride. The defender&#8217;s jacket had been torn off.
There was a slight cut on his forehead. But his little
bloodshot eyes glared with undiminished drunken defiance;
nor had his opponents&#8217; best efforts dislodged
his legs from about the pillar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the sacred Arareek!&#8221; muttered Caine, leaning
across toward Conover. &#8220;Dillingham will be in hysterics
in another minute. The sanctity of his state dinner
shattered just when he was at his asinine best!
See, some of the women are starting to go. If they
leave, it&#8217;ll break his heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Caleb did not hear. Almost alone of all those
in the room, he had shown no excitement. Fights
were no novelty to him. Bent forward, yet emotionless,
his eyes had never once left the distorted face of
the drunken interloper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave me be!&#8221; the latter was demanding in a
squealing hiccough, as the cessation of attack left him
breath for words. &#8220;Leave me be, can&#8217;t yer? Fine
lot&mdash;swellsh you are, to pick on one poor old man
what never harmed none of you! Lemme &#8217;<i>lone</i>!&#8221; as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
Dillingham with thoughts of diplomacy, edged closer.
&#8220;That&mdash;that feller called me&mdash;p&mdash;panhandler! &#8217;S
a lie! I&#8217;m honesh, &#8217;spectible workin&#8217; man. Fought
for m&#8217; country in S-S-Shivil war. Got m&#8217; hon&#8217;rable-dishcharge.
Fought for m&#8217; country while the most of
you was in&mdash;in y&#8217;r cradles. I&#8217;m drunk too,&#8221; he confided
squinting up at the unnerved Dillingham.
&#8220;Drunk&mdash;or I wouldn&#8217;t a&#8217; stholen thoshe thingsh.
Perfec&#8217;ly shquare when I&#8217;m shober. Perf&#8217;ly.
Learned t&#8217;drink while I was d&mdash;d&#8217;fendin&#8217; m&#8217; country.
I&#8217;m&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice scaled a note or two, broke, and then
meandered on, in time to prevent Dillingham&#8217;s interruption.
His tone had shifted once more from the
explanatory to the pugnacious.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had had my&mdash;my rightsh!&#8221; he bellowed,
shrilly, glaring about him. &#8220;I&#8217;d be ridin&#8217; in my
carr&#8217;ge&mdash;m&#8217;own carr&#8217;ge! Yesh! Thash right.
Own carr&#8217;ge. Got a boy whoshe rich&mdash;rich man.
Whatsh&#8217;e do for me? Noshin&#8217;t&#8217;all! Don&#8217;t ev&#8217;n
know I&#8217;m &#8217;live. Till I struck Granite t&#8217;night, I didn&#8217;t
know <i>he</i>&#8217;sh &#8217;live. Firsh time been here in twenty
yearsh. They shent m&#8217;t&#8217; jail, lasht time, dammem!
Poor ol&#8217; Saul Con&#8217;ver!&#8221;</p>

<p>He broke into senile, weak sobbing. And, from all
over the room rose a confused whispering, a rustle, an
indefinable electric thrill. Women whose escorts had
led them to the door, halted and looked back in crass
interest. Men glanced at one another, muttering queries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
that found no answer. Even Dillingham forgot
at last his faint hope of restoring the shattered function
to its former banal calm.</p>

<p>Pair by pair, all eyes slowly focussed on Caleb Conover.
But the most imaginative gazer could not descry
emotion&mdash;whether of surprise, chagrin or fear&mdash;on
the heavy mask of the Fighter&#8217;s face. For a moment
there was a hush. The old man on the floor
still sobbed in maudlin fashion. But no one heeded
him. Then Caine arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; he began, his pleasant, low-pitched voice
breaking in like a dash of cool water on his hearers&#8217;
superheated senses, &#8220;I think there is no need for any
of us to magnify this trifling break in our jolly evening;
nor to allow it to mar in any way our spirit of
good fellowship. May I propose that we&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on,&#8221; interposed Caleb, quietly. He got to
his feet and laid a detaining hand on Caine&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;an&#8217; I thank you. But
I think this is where <i>I</i> do the talkin&#8217;, an&#8217; not you. I&#8217;ve
never made a speech here before,&#8221; he went on, raising
his voice, &#8220;An&#8217; I never expected to. But I&#8217;ll ask
you people to have patience with me for a minute or
two. Because there&#8217;s one or two things that&#8217;s got to
be said here an&#8217; now. An&#8217; I&#8217;m the one that&#8217;s got to
say &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced about him. Never before in the Arareek
Club had orator enjoyed so rapt an audience.
The quiet, heavy voice, the brute magnetism of the
man, no less than curiosity as to how he would handle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
so impossible a situation, had already caught everyone&#8217;s
attention. His wholly masterful manner, his latent
strength, lent a force of their own to his rough
words as he went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that man doubled up
on the floor there is my father&mdash;I didn&#8217;t know till five
minutes ago that he was still alive. I hadn&#8217;t seen nor
heard of him in near twenty-five years; till he came
in here, crazy drunk, just now, an&#8217; broke up your party.
I&#8217;m sorry for what he&#8217;s done. If I could make any
kind of rep&#8217;ration to you for the bother he&#8217;s caused,
I&#8217;d do it. I guess you know that. But I can&#8217;t. All
I can do is to try to make you look at him less like he
was a mangy dog in a fit, an&#8217; more as if he was a human
like yourselves. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m takin&#8217; the liberty
to speak to you now. Will you hear me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The unconscious buzz and murmur that all at
once swept the room served him for answer; and he
continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;My father,&#8221; with another nod toward the mumbling
figure on the floor, &#8220;was a risin&#8217;, hard workin&#8217;
man. He come of decent people, an&#8217; he was a promisin&#8217;
young chap that ev&#8217;rybody liked. That was the
trouble. Too many folks liked him; which is pretty
near as bad as bein&#8217; liked by nobody. Nothin&#8217; pers&#8217;nal
intended. When the Civil War broke out he went to
the front. There he learned to starve, to loaf, to forget
his business trainin&#8217;. An&#8217; he wasn&#8217;t the only one,
I guess. There&#8217;s where he learned to drink, too.
When men have to go supperless to bed on the wet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
ground after an all-day march, a swig of whiskey&#8217;s a
blessin&#8217;. It&#8217;s a blessin&#8217;, too, when it dulls the mem&#8217;ry
of the comrade at your side that was blowed to pieces
by a shell or ripped open by a bay&#8217;net. Can you blame
the soldiers if they let the whiskey bless &#8217;em so often
that it gets to be a habit?</p>

<p>&#8220;After the war my father come home. There&#8217;d
been bands of music an&#8217; women wavin&#8217; handkerchi&#8217;fs
an&#8217; noospapers to call him an&#8217; his fellers a lot of hot-air
names when they marched off in their bloo uniforms
to the war. When the boys came slouchin&#8217;
back, footsore, ragged, an&#8217; so thin they looked like
walkin&#8217; embalmer advertisements, there wasn&#8217;t quite
so much cheerin&#8217;. My father&#8217;d gone away a brisk,
fine set-up lad, leavin&#8217; good work behind him. He
come back like a good many thousand others, none the
better for a four-year course in shiftlessness, booze an&#8217;
no reg&#8217;lar work.</p>

<p>&#8220;The folks who&#8217;d cheered him when he went to
fight for &#8217;em had cheered away a lot of their spare
patri&#8217;tism by that time. There wa&#8217;nt enough of it
left in Granite to give my father a fair start in the
world again. Because he&#8217;d learned to drink, to loaf,
to be uneasy an&#8217; unreliable when he worked, they forgot
he&#8217;d picked up those tricks while he was defendin&#8217;
their country. Heroes was a drug in the market. If
any of you fellers know how it feels to get down to
work the day after your fortnight&#8217;s vacation, maybe
you can understand what it meant to him to settle
down to a job after four years in the open.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>Conover glanced again at his father. The old man
had ceased to mumble and was trying to follow the
Fighter&#8217;s speech. The slack jaw had tightened; and
the huddled form was struggling slowly to its feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;He tried to work,&#8221; resumed Conover, &#8220;but
younger, smarter folks with steadier business trainin&#8217;
was grabbin&#8217; all the good jobs. Yet he got what he
could, an&#8217; for awhile he did the best he knew how.
Then he saw a chance to make things easier for my
mother an&#8217; me. He&#8217;d been used to seein&#8217; his off&#8217;cers
in the army paddin&#8217; expense accounts an&#8217; gettin&#8217; graft
on fodder bills an&#8217; such. He&#8217;d seen contractors grow
rich by sellin&#8217; the Gov&#8217;ment shoddy blankets an&#8217; rotten
food. Was it any worse for <i>him</i> to scamp weights
on the coal scales? That&#8217;s what he done. Not in big
quantities as if he was a financier; but a few cents a
day as he got the chance.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was his mistake. If he&#8217;d stole a million he&#8217;d
a&#8217; been a big man in Granite. But he hadn&#8217;t the brain
to do more&#8217;n foller, a long way off, the example of
the men he&#8217;d been taught to obey for four years. Because
he stole so little an&#8217; so stoopidly, they found him
out. They didn&#8217;t stop to ask if he&#8217;d used the miser&#8217;ble
little sums of pilfered money to make his home
happier an&#8217; buy things for his sick wife. Those arguments
don&#8217;t cut much ice in law. He was just a
common thief. An&#8217; they sent him to States prison.
Me an&#8217; my mother could starve, for all the law cared.
The bread winner was locked up. That was all holy
Justice asked for. <i>We</i> could die of hunger if we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
wanted to, now that the law had taken away the man
who had stole to keep us alive.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you folks has read of the way men get
treated in those places where the State gives &#8217;em a
chance to repent of their sins. For five years my
father lived in a stone cubbyhole an&#8217; had for chums a
choice c&#8217;lection of the Devil&#8217;s Own Brigade. Not a
soul in all that time to speak a decent word to him,&mdash;to
say &#8216;Please,&#8217; in givin&#8217; him his orders. It sounds
like a small thing to have no one say &#8216;Please&#8217; to you.
But try it some time.</p>

<p>&#8220;After five years of herdin&#8217; with beasts,&mdash;only
bein&#8217; treated worse&#8217;n the S. P. C. A. would let any
beast be treated,&mdash;they turned my father loose.
They&#8217;d set the prison mark on him; they&#8217;d taught him
to keep comp&#8217;ny with blackguards; they&#8217;d made him
callous to everything decent, an&#8217; taken away his citizenship.
Havin&#8217; done which, they gen&#8217;rously sets him
free an&#8217; gives him a chance to be a Godfearin&#8217;, upright
man in future. Who&#8217;ll hire a convict? Who&#8217;ll give
him a show? No one&mdash;You know that as well as I
do. How can he hold up his head among men who
haven&#8217;t had the bad luck to be caught? What was
left for my father to do? To &#8217;sociate with the only
class that&#8217;d take him as an equal. To turn to the
drink that made him forget they&#8217;d branded him as an
outcast. That&#8217;s what he did. I ain&#8217;t sayin&#8217; it&#8217;s right.
I ain&#8217;t sayin&#8217; that Saul Conover&#8217;s a noble lookin&#8217; work
of God as he slinks against that post there. The
drink that comforted him so long has knocked out his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
manhood. The hard luck an&#8217; starvin&#8217; has turned him
old and ugly an&#8217; bad-shaped. In short, he&#8217;s what
S&#8217;ciety an&#8217; a lovin&#8217; Paternal Gov&#8217;ment has made him.
An&#8217;&mdash;he&#8217;s my father, God help him! An&#8217; the man
who says I&#8217;m ashamed of him, lies!&#8221;</p>

<p>Amid the oppressed silence, Caleb Conover crossed
over to where his father stood cowed and half-sobered.
As gently as a woman, he put his arm about the old
man&#8217;s twisted shoulders and drew him toward the
door. A lane was made for their passage. From
somewhere in the crowd came the sound of a woman&#8217;s
stifled sob. Jack Hawarden impulsively clapped his
hands together. There was an instant&#8217;s shocked
silence. Then&mdash;no one could afterward explain why&mdash;the
lad&#8217;s example was followed from all quarters
of the dining hall; and a rattle of incongruous applause
re-echoed through the place.</p>

<p>As Conover, half-leading, half-supporting the wizened
form, neared the door, young Hawarden barred
his path. With boyish hero-worship shining in his
eyes, Jack thrust out his hand. Caleb gripped it in
silence and passed on, out into the darkness. None
followed the strange pair as they left the clubhouse.</p>

<p>Neither father nor son spoke a word until they
were alone in the starlit road, far beyond earshot of
the club. Then Caleb stopped, glancing back as
though fearful lest some inquisitive guest might have
come out to witness the sequel to the banquet hall
scene. The night air had still further cleared the
drink-fog from the old man&#8217;s brain. Clutching his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
son by the sleeve, and tremblingly patting the Fighter&#8217;s
big hand, he whimpered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gawd bless you, boy! It&#8217;s a proud man I am this
night. You&#8217;re not ashamed of your poor old father
what worked so hard for you an&#8217; loves you so an&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>With a gesture of loathing, Caleb shook off the
weak clasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;You measly old crook!&#8221; he snarled. &#8220;Keep
your dirty hands off me! Here!&#8221; thrusting a roll of
bills upon him. &#8220;Take this an&#8217; get out of town by
the next train. Write me where to forward money
an&#8217; I&#8217;ll see you get enough to keep you drunk till you
die. But if you ever set foot in Granite again I&#8217;ll
have you railroaded to jail for life. An&#8217;, after this,
don&#8217;t spring that Civil War yarn again. Civil War
hard-luck stories are played out. Besides, you were
never within two hundred miles of the war; and you
know you weren&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t lie when you don&#8217;t have to.
It spoils your skill for nec&#8217;ssary lies. Now, get away
from here! Chase!&#8221;</p>

<small>A PEACE CONFERENCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why we were all so carried away by
it,&#8221; said Caine, reflectively. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking it
over. There was much more bathos than pathos; and
a delightful absence of both elegance and eloquence
about his speech. Yet for a moment I was almost
tempted to join in your charmingly ill-timed applause.
The whole thing savored of cheap melodrama.
But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the man himself. Not what he said,&#8221; answered
Jack Hawarden, eager in defense of his new-built
idol. &#8220;He stood there facing a crowd that
would have liked nothing better than to annihilate
him. That drunken Thing on the floor was enough
by itself to ruin him forever at the Arareek. Yet
Conover made us listen and he swayed us to suit himself.
Not by what he said, but by his own big
strength, I think. There&#8217;s something about him I
don&#8217;t understand. But he&#8217;s a <i>man</i>. And, after to-night,&mdash;whatever
the others say&mdash;I take my hat off
to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the perfecting of a young author&#8217;s style,&#8221; observed
Caine, irrelevantly, &#8220;what sample of nervous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
English can be finer than Carlyle&#8217;s &#8216;<i>Heroes and Hero
Worship</i>?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>His raillery jarred on the boy&#8217;s enthusiasm and
checked the gush of extravagant praise. Letty
Standish, with whom the two were walking home
from the Club, took advantage of Jack&#8217;s snubbed
silence, to put in a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think Mr. Hawarden is right, Amzi,&#8221; she ventured.
&#8220;There&#8217;s something about Mr. Conover that
one can&#8217;t very well define. I think he could make one
do anything he chose. I know <i>I</i> was almost&mdash;afraid
of him,&mdash;before I&#8217;d known him ten minutes. I don&#8217;t
quite think I like him. He&#8217;s so powerful, so rough, so
domineering. Not like anyone I ever met before.
But,&#8221; with a slight shudder, &#8220;I believe I&#8217;d do whatever
he ordered me to. Especially if he scowled at
me in that bullying way, with his eyes half-shut.
Isn&#8217;t it funny to feel like that about a person you
hardly know?&#8221;</p>

<p>She ended with a nervous laugh, and looked up at
Caine with a pretty, helpless air of seeking protection.
Amzi always found this appealing attitude irresistible.
If social longings were Conover&#8217;s &#8220;feet of clay,&#8221; Letty
Standish served as a similar pedal handicap for
Caine. He wished young Hawarden had not thrust
himself upon the t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te of their homeward walk.
He wanted, loverlike, to reassure Letty with unspeakably
doughty promises of safeguard from peril; to see
her soft round eyes raised to his in the admiration such
protestations are wont to excite between very young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
or very old lovers. But Jack was doggedly treading
along beside them in all the charming ignorance of his
age and temperament. The boy&#8217;s sulks were even
now dissolving and he joined again in the talk; still
harping on his hero.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never met Conover till this morning,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;I wish now I&#8217;d known him better. It&#8217;s queer I never
met him at Miss Shevlin&#8217;s. She&#8217;s his ward, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty, to whom he spoke, answered with a tinge of
the latent sub-acid in her gentle voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know. But I&#8217;ve noticed things about
Miss Shevlin that made it seem quite likely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Shevlin,&#8221; said the boy, hotly, &#8220;is the prettiest,
brightest, best-bred girl I ever knew. If you
mean she is&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say,&#8221; answered Letty with elaborate carelessness.
&#8220;But I never noticed her especially.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see,&#8221; persisted Jack, &#8220;how you could have
helped it. She&#8217;s the sort of girl everyone notices.
There&#8217;s something about her&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what a zealous champion she has!&#8221; exclaimed
Letty, playfully, her laughter ringing thin.
&#8220;I congratulate her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t,&#8221; retorted Jack. &#8220;And I&#8217;m afraid
you&#8217;ll never even have a chance to congratulate <i>me</i>.
I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, Hawarden,&#8221; interposed Caine, lazily
pouring oil on the churned waters, according to his
wont. &#8220;I read your <i>Scribner&#8217;s</i> story to-day. I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
congratulate you on <i>that</i>, at any rate, can&#8217;t I? It was
decidedly good. I wondered at your knowledge of
human nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hawarden&#8217;s chest swelled. At twenty-two, who
does not know human nature as never can it be known
in later years? And who does not rejoice at recognition
of that vast knowledge?</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had some experience with life, in my time,&#8221;
said Jack, darkly. &#8220;And I paint my fellow-man as
I see him. Not as he ought to be. But as he is. If I
seem merciless in my character drawing&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do indeed!&#8221; began Caine. But a fit of very
well executed coughing cut short his righteous praise.
Jack, disappointed, sought to lead the talk back to
the former happy theme.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m writing a story now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that is bigger
in every way than anything I&#8217;ve done before. But I
can&#8217;t decide yet, even in my own mind, whether it is
very good or very bad. It is one or the other. I
know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s enough of either,&#8221; replied Caine, &#8220;it is certain
to make a popular hit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve made De&mdash;Miss Shevlin my heroine,&#8221; pursued
Hawarden, scornfully disregarding Caine&#8217;s untimely
flippancy. &#8220;But it&#8217;s hard to put a girl like her
on paper the way one sees her in one&#8217;s mind. I wrote
a poem about her once. <i>Harper&#8217;s Magazine</i> accepted
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused. Then, ridden by the demon of truth,
added with reluctance, &#8220;They published it in fine print<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
over toward the end. But,&#8221; more buoyantly, &#8220;I saw
it copied afterward in no less than two papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you put Mr. Conover into a story,
too?&#8221; suggested Letty, unwilling not to seem quite at
home in so profound a literary discussion. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t
he make a good character? He&#8217;s so&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not,&#8221; decided the boy, judicially
weighing his verdict. &#8220;He&#8217;s more of a <i>man</i> than
anyone else in all my experience. But he wouldn&#8217;t
quite fit into a story, I&#8217;m afraid. You see, he lacks
romance, for one thing. One could hardly fancy
Caleb Conover in love. And then&mdash;unless you count
this evening&#8217;s affair&mdash;I doubt if he was ever in an
adventure of any sort in his life. His character, from
a literary viewpoint, doesn&#8217;t lend itself to action or
analysis. In making the study of human nature my
hobby, I have&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see!&#8221; broke in Letty, almost sharply. &#8220;You
are quite right. He would be impossible in a story&mdash;as
he is in real life!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly think so,&#8221; demurred Caine. &#8220;Not impossible.
Improbable, at worst. I am afraid a great
many people in Granite will find that out before he is
through.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had reached the Standish home. Hawarden
bade them goodnight at the door; declining Letty&#8217;s
perfunctory invitation to come in. The evening was
still young. But the lack of cordiality in Letty&#8217;s voice
grated on his armor of youth. He reflected somewhat
belatedly that she and Caine were engaged and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
that it was possible they might find themes even more
alluring than literature to talk over, together. So, unwilling,
he left them.</p>

<p>Caine and Letty strolled slowly up the walk. The
night was cool, for June. So, ignoring the lounging
chairs on the veranda, they passed into the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is one of the last evenings we can sit indoors,&#8221;
commented Letty. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to realize that
summer is so near. I suppose this week will wind up
the season. Everywhere else except in old-fashioned
Granite, it must have ended weeks ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. We&#8217;re old-fashioned here in Granite,&#8221; said
Caine, seating himself on the arm of the chair into
which she had thrown herself. &#8220;I think somebody
once left an 1860 calendar in this town, and we&#8217;ve all
been living by it ever since. We&#8217;re like the scaly,
finny Oldest Inhabitants in the poem, who dreamed
away their lives in the coral grove, while a seven stanza
storm roared across the ocean overhead. When the
storm of progress cuts a little below the surface we
Granite folk blink upward from our dreams in pained
disapproval. I think that&#8217;s why we look askance at
Conover. He represents&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, am I to have that dreadful creature&#8217;s name
forever dinned into my ears?&#8221; complained Letty.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it enough that Father makes us ask him here to
dinner, Friday; without <i>your</i> talking forever about
him in the little while people leave us alone together?
In another minute Aunt Lydia will be pottering in to
play propriety. And then&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>&#8220;And then, &#8216;Fly from the Aunt, thou sluggard!&#8217;
shall be my motto,&#8221; finished Caine. &#8220;I wish her virtues
didn&#8217;t oppress me so. I wouldn&#8217;t object to her so
much, if someone whose vocabulary was as limited as
his knowledge of heaven&#8217;s <i>personnel</i>, hadn&#8217;t once described
her looks as &#8216;Saintly.&#8217; She has been trying so
hard to live up to the picture, ever since, that it&#8217;s a
bit wearing on poor sinners like me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wicked to be so sacrilegious,&#8221; returned Letty,
primly. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t like to have you speak so of
my family. After all, she is my aunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think for a moment I&#8217;m blaming <i>you</i> for
that, sweetheart,&#8221; he protested with an earnestness
that left Letty as usual in doubt whether or not he had
perpetrated some witticism she ought to have seen.
Taking hasty mental review of their talk, she decided
he had not, and went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;And her face <i>is</i> saintly. You know she&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it is,&#8221; he acquiesced. &#8220;But what a pity
Fra Angelico and Rafael couldn&#8217;t have seen her!
Then we should have had all those cherubs and red-and-gold
angels of theirs depicted with thin gray hair
parted in the middle, and with gray switches and half-inch
eye-glasses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have grown coarse from associating with
that Conover man,&#8221; pouted Letty. &#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s indelicate
to speak of switches. And it hurts my feelings
cruelly to have you abuse the people I love!&#8221;</p>

<p>The tears, always comfortably near the surface,
trembled in Letty&#8217;s voice and eyes. Caine, in a fever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
of remorse, begged forgiveness and tried to put his
arm about her. But she drew away with a little hunch
of the shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve spoiled my evening!&#8221; she wailed. &#8220;First
you introduced that miserable man to me and made
him frighten me, and now you make fun of&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Footsteps crossing the hall brought her tale of
wrong to an abrupt halt. She sat up and furtively
mopped her eyes. Tears were so common and so easy
a relief to her that normally they left scant mark of
their presence. Caine rose and faced the door; the
distressed lover merging as by magic into the bored,
suave man of the world.</p>

<p>Reuben Standish&#8217;s widowed sister-in-law glided into
the room, diffusing an aura of mild beneficence that
struck Caine&#8217;s nerves to the raw. Her near-sighted
eyes turned as in lofty benediction upon the lovers;
her thick glasses diffusing and magnifying the glance
until it seemed to embrace all the visible world.</p>

<p>Mrs. Standish, on the death of her husband, had
come to keep house for her widower brother-in-law.
She had brought with her her orphaned grandnephew,
Clive, (only son of Letty&#8217;s elder brother, long dead),
whose upbringing was at once her chief visible claim to
sanctity and her scriptural thorn in the flesh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clive has been so bad again this evening!&#8221; she
said with a sigh, after a distant greeting to Caine, &#8220;I
suppose these crosses are sent to us. But sometimes
I am nearly tempted to wonder why. I actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
caught him tacking his grandfather&#8217;s slippers to the
floor, where I had left them, in front of the chiffonier,
in Mr. Standish&#8217;s room. I locked him in the nursery
for an hour while I prayed to see my duty clear. And
when I went to him, strengthened and inspired to
make him see his fault, what do you think I found him
doing? The hardened boy was actually drawing
caricature, depicting his grandfather trying to walk
in the tacked-down slippers. He had not even the
grace to hide it when he saw me coming. There was
nothing left for me to do but to whip him. So I have
sent him out to cut a small stick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little chap!&#8221; muttered Caine, stifling a smile.
He was fond of the boy, who in turn idolized him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; went on Amzi, aloud, &#8220;If, instead of
whipping him, you could let me talk to him and explain&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Lydia!&#8221; piped a voice from the doorway.
A little Eton-suited boy with a mop of yellow hair
and sorrowful dark eyes, hesitated on the threshold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>here</i> you are,&#8221; added the child, coming into
the room and walking straight up to Mrs. Standish.
&#8220;I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the stick?&#8221; asked Nemesis, her glasses
reflecting less sanctity than was their custom, as they
sought a glimpse of the hands Clive held clasped behind
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; replied the boy, apologetically. &#8220;It
was so dark I couldn&#8217;t find a stick. But,&#8221; with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
propitiatory smile, as he brought his hands forward,
&#8220;Here are two stones you can throw at me, instead,
if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caine&#8217;s laughter exploded; breaking in with scandalous
intrusion, upon the penitential scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Caine,&#8221; said Mrs. Standish, her coldly righteous
rebuke rising above Letty&#8217;s milder reproval, &#8220;I
think, perhaps, for discipline&#8217;s sake, it might be well
for you to end your call before you do anything more
to make this wicked boy regard his fault as a matter
for levity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caine glanced in humorous appeal toward Letty.
But his fianc&eacute;e, as usual in matters of family crisis,
only stared back in piteous fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Caine,&#8221; called Clive, as the visitor completed
somewhat frigid adieux and moved toward the door,
&#8220;I am <i>very</i> sorry I got you into trouble. I&#8217;m afraid
Aunt Lydia don&#8217;t <i>quite</i> understand us men.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>INTO AN UNKNOWN LAND</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The red-haired man was fighting.</p>

<p>He had always been fighting. But to-night he must
wield weapons whereof he had no experience; unskilled,
must meet deft opponents on their own ground.
The thought thrilled him, with the joy of the born
fighter.</p>

<p>The hour for the Standish dinner was seven; that
the meal might be well over before the musicale guests
should begin to arrive. Caleb rang the Standish bell
at twenty minutes before seven. The manservant
who admitted him managed to convey from behind a
totally mask-like face that there was something amiss
with the arrival. Glancing into the drawing room as
he followed a maid to the men&#8217;s dressing room upstairs,
Caleb saw it was quite devoid of guests. In
fact, a servant was lighting the lamps there. The
dressing room, too, was deserted.</p>

<p>Conover was vaguely puzzled. Surely the invitation
had fixed the hour for seven? And he was nearly
twenty minutes ahead of time. At functions such as
he was wont to attend, people always began to drop in
nearly half an hour beforehand. So fearful had he
been to-night of breaking some unknown social rule,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
that he had allowed a full twenty minutes leeway.
Yet he was very palpably the first to arrive. This
perplexed and shamed him. It even shook his iron
self-confidence. He caught himself hoping that none
of the Standishes knew he was there. The man who
had with cool derision, faced hostile legislatures, investigation
committees and actual physical danger;
felt his nerve turning into nerves.</p>

<p>A tray of cigarettes lay on the chiffonier. Caleb
had never smoked a cigarette. He wondered if etiquette
commanded that he should do so now. He
weighed the matter judicially as he took off his coat
and gloves; then decided that the cigarettes had indisputedly
been put there to be smoked. Gingerly, he
lighted one. The aromatic mild flavor of the smoke
disgusted him. He had always despised men who
chose cigarettes in preference to cigars. Now he regarded
such smokers as idiotic rather than decadent.
Yet he puffed dutifully at the abhorred paper tube and
pondered on the probability of his being called upon to
repeat the performance, later, in the dining room. He
had heard of people smoking cigarettes with dinner.
Or, rather, hadn&#8217;t he seen pictures of such a scene?
Yes. Surely. A picture on a calendar in the general
passenger agent&#8217;s office. But the smokers, in the
picture, were women. And one of them had her feet
on the table. Caleb mentally apologized to his present
hostesses and dismissed the theme.</p>

<p>When dinner was at seven, why shouldn&#8217;t people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
come on time? Was there a joke in it somewhere?
A joke on himself? Anything, just now, seemed
possible. What was the use of smoking this measly
cigarette when there was no one to see? He dropped
it into a bronze dish, went over to the cheval glass
and surveyed himself from head to foot. Then he
turned; and, looking over one shoulder, sought to see
how his dress coat fitted in the back. The twisting of
his body caused a huge central wrinkle to spring out between
his shoulders, creases diverging from it. Also
there was a spear of stiff red hair in the very center
of his well-brushed head that had escaped from the
combined lures of pomade and water. Conover
crossed to the chiffonier, picked up one of a pair of
military brushes and attacked the rebellious lock with
vigor.</p>

<p>There was no water in sight. How did these people
expect a man to brush his hair without water? No
pomade, either. Not even brilliantine. Could it be
that folk of the Standish class did not use such aids?
Or did they keep them locked up? Caleb&#8217;s eyes swept
the room and its quiet furnishings appraisingly. It
did not represent at all his idea of luxury. Not a bow,
not a tidy, not a fancy screen nor a lambrequin in sight.
Yet there was an indefinable something about the place
that met his approval. He fell to walking back and
forth, uneasily; pausing every now and then in front
of the cheval glass.</p>

<p>Amzi Caine, who had come early in the futile hope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
of a word alone with Letty before the dinner, found
him thus employed. Conover swung around on his
friend with a grunt of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he said, his heavy voice actually cordial,
&#8220;I begun to think it was Judgment Day an&#8217; that I
was the first one resurrected. How&#8217;d I look? All
right? Nothin&#8217; wrong in this get-up is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The glass of fashion and the mould of form!&#8221;
laughed Caine, &#8220;Behold a phenomenon! The worker
of miracles&mdash;and Steeloids&mdash;deigns to ask a mere
mortal&#8217;s opinion!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, is it?&#8221; said Conover, relieved. &#8220;Say,&#8221;
he went on suspiciously, &#8220;You&#8217;re guying me! Tell
me what&#8217;s wrong. Be honest, can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you insist,&#8221; replied Caine, nettled at the domineering
tone, &#8220;I can&#8217;t just hint that most men don&#8217;t
wear diamond studs with evening dress, and that your
tie is rather too evidently a &#8216;masterpiece not made by
hands.&#8217; Otherwise, you look very fit indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caleb scowled in the glass at the flashing studs and
the ready-made lawn tie. Then, brushing away the
gnat of worry, he answered, carelessly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to dress like everybody else. Too much
sameness for me. It&#8217;s well enough for fellers without
an idee or a scrap of originality in their heads. I like
to do a little different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A Beau Brummell come to Judgment!&#8221;
mocked Caine, &#8220;But with diamonds rising in price ten
per cent. a year, I hope you won&#8217;t set the fashion just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
yet. You&#8217;ll break us. It&#8217;s all very well to dress regardless
of expense&mdash;or style&mdash;but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let it go at that,&#8221; ordered Conover sullenly,
&#8220;There&#8217;s something else I wanted to ask you about,
first time I saw you alone. You told me one day that
Desir&eacute;e Shevlin could take any place she wanted, in
s&#8217;ciety here, if only she married the right sort of a man.
Remember?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes. But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, would it work both ways? I mean, if <i>I</i> was
to marry a girl who had a big social position in Granite,
would it help me on, any?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;should think so,&#8221; hesitated Caine, overcoming
a desire to laugh at the unique idea. &#8220;Why? Are
you thinking of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly thinkin&#8217; of it, but turnin&#8217; it over in
my mind. If I was <i>thinkin&#8217;</i> about it I&#8217;d do it. That&#8217;s
my way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is the lucky damsel?&#8221; bantered Caine, &#8220;Or
haven&#8217;t you selected her yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve about picked her out,&#8221; said Caleb slowly,
&#8220;Just now she&#8217;s keepin&#8217; comp&#8217;ny with another man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you won&#8217;t let that stand in your way for
an instant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; returned Caleb, on whom irony of any sort
was ever lost, &#8220;Of course not. I have a way of
gettin&#8217; what I want. I only wish,&#8221; he continued with
a half sigh of weariness, &#8220;that I could always keep on
wantin&#8217; what I get.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>Clive Standish ran into the room. From one of the
servants he had heard of Caine&#8217;s arrival.</p>

<p>&#8220;What fun to find you before you go down!&#8221; he
cried, &#8220;I was afraid you wouldn&#8217;t see me to-night and I
knew you&#8217;d be disappointed. Aunt Lydia won&#8217;t let
me sit up for the musicale, because I was bad
last evening. And she&#8217;s made me learn a hymn called
&#8216;I Know That God is Wroth With Me!&#8217; besides.
The hymn is signed &#8216;I. Watts.&#8217; I think &#8216;I. Watts&#8217;
must have been a very sorrowful person. I wonder if
God really disliked him as much as &#8216;I. Watts&#8217; pretended.
He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The child checked himself, catching sight of Caleb.
&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see there was
anyone here besides Mr. Caine. Mr. Caine,&#8221; he explained,
condescendingly, &#8220;is a friend of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on with your gabfest together, then,&#8221; vouchsafed
Caleb, with an effort at unbending. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
mind <i>me</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s brows contracted at sound of the false
note in Caleb&#8217;s voice. He looked at the Fighter long
and with frank criticism. Caleb bore the scrutiny with
visible discomfort. He was not fond of children and
did not understand them. Having had no childhood
himself he could nowhere meet them on equal
terms. Yet, as this slender, Eton-suited youngster
was apparently a relative of Letty&#8217;s and a member of
the same household, he sought to improve the acquaintance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know a little rat about your age,&#8221; he began,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
with elephantine geniality, &#8220;His name&#8217;s Billy Shevlin.
Smart boy, too. Sharp as a whip. Ever meet him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; replied Clive, &#8220;I think not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No? You wouldn&#8217;t be likely to, I s&#8217;pose. While
you&#8217;re home, evenin&#8217;s, learnin&#8217; hymns, he&#8217;s out learnin&#8217;
life. Spends most of his evenin&#8217;s round at the
fire-house. Why, that kid knows the name of each
engine in town the minute he hears &#8217;em whistle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clive&#8217;s eyes grew wistful with envy; yet abated
none of the unconscious criticism wherewith they were
still scrutinizing the Fighter. His lack of response
confused Caleb; who started off on a new tack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Billy&#8217;s a great boy. He used to have a lot of
cunnin&#8217; tricks, too, when he was little. He&#8217;s outgrowin&#8217;
&#8217;em now. Used to tiptoe up behind me an&#8217;
put both his dirty little hands over my eyes an&#8217; say:
&#8216;Guess who&#8217;s here?&#8217; An&#8217; then I&#8217;d guess &#8216;General
Grant&#8217; an&#8217; &#8216;Abe Lincoln&#8217; and &#8216;Queen Victoria&#8217; an&#8217;
&#8216;Tom Platt&#8217; an&#8217; a lot of other big guns; till all of a
sudden I&#8217;d guess &#8216;Billy Shevlin!&#8217; An&#8217; he&#8217;d squeal
out &#8216;Yes!&#8217; Not much sense in it. But kind of cute
for such a little feller. I remember some folks were
callin&#8217; there one day an&#8217; I wanted him to play that
game, to show off before &#8217;em. But he was kind of
bashful and wouldn&#8217;t. An&#8217; that made me mad; so I
cuffed him over the head. An&#8217; since then, somehow,
he&#8217;s never played it any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder!&#8221; gasped Clive. &#8220;I&mdash;excuse me,
sir,&#8221; he caught himself up, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to be
rude.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>&#8220;Go ahead!&#8221; laughed Caleb, &#8220;That ain&#8217;t rude. It&#8217;s
bein&#8217; honest. Don&#8217;t let &#8217;em make a Miss Nancy of you
by teachin&#8217; you to &#8217;pologize an&#8217; say &#8216;please,&#8217; an&#8217; &#8216;Sir&#8217;
an&#8217; all those folderols.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>like</i> to say them,&#8221; retorted Clive, &#8220;And I&#8217;m not
a Miss Nancy. Last week I thrashed a boy two years
older than I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out, Conover!&#8221; warned Caine, solemnly,
&#8220;He may pick you for the next victim.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the sound of the name, Clive had glanced
sharply at Caleb.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he put in, now, &#8220;But you
aren&#8217;t &#8216;Brute&#8217; Conover, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clive!&#8221; admonished Caine, with what severity he
could summon up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I b&#8217;lieve I&#8217;ve been called that a few times,&#8221; answered
Caleb, in high good humor. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said Clive, backing toward the door,
&#8220;from what I read in the newspapers about you,&mdash;and
from something I once heard Grandpapa say,&mdash;I
don&#8217;t think I care to know you, Mr. Conover. I&#8217;m
sorry. Goodnight.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Caleb Conover had not known there were so many
kinds of forks in existence. From his oyster plate
they stretched away to the left in what seemed an interminable
vista. Had Desir&eacute;e told him to begin with
the left-hand fork and work inward, as the courses
progressed? Or was it the right-hand fork he was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
begin with and work outward? A furtive glance at
Letty, on his right, solved the problem.</p>

<p>Then, the same glance sweeping the table, he found
he was the only person whose doubled napkin had not
disappeared. He pulled it unnoticed down to his
knee. A roll fell from its hidden interior and crashed
to the floor with a report that sounded to him loud
enough to shake the house. But the sound passed unheard,
in the ripple of talk. Caleb kicked the offending
bit of bread further under the table and sombrely
attacked his oysters.</p>

<p>A cocktail had heralded the meal. This, with his
glass of dry sherry, now began little by little to cut
away the Fighter&#8217;s crust of stark self-consciousness.
He was not wont, of late years, to touch liquor at all;
although in early days his Gargantuan drinking bouts
had been the wonder of the local Underworld. On
his unaccustomed senses the slight stimulant now
acted with redoubled force. It sharpened his wits,
banished his first feeling of stiff discomfort, enabled
him to come out of himself and take note of what
went on about him.</p>

<p>Caine talking animatedly just opposite, was nevertheless
looking unobtrusively at Conover. So were
Reuben Standish and others at the table. To their
varied relief or disappointment the big, silent man had
perpetrated thus far none of the capers which comic
stories ascribe to <i>parvenus</i>. He handled his soup-spoon
with an inward sweep, it is true; but he ate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
quietly and as one not wholly unaccustomed to civilized
methods. Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s long and stern training was
standing him in good stead.</p>

<p>Letty, emboldened by these repeated signs of house-brokenness,
ventured a few perfunctory remarks to
him. Caleb replied briefly, but without embarrassment.
He even answered a question put him from
across the table, with the same self-possession. Caine
relaxed his nervous vigilance. His reluctant admiration
for the newcomer was increasing.</p>

<p>Conover, with the true fighter&#8217;s intuition, noted all
the tokens of his own well-being, and his dawning
self-possession grew steadily stronger.</p>

<p>The talk at his end of the table had turned into
musical channels.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were able to get Miss Tyson for the musicale
after all,&#8221; Letty was saying. &#8220;She was to have sung
at the Worcester Music Festival, you know; but at
the last moment they engaged someone else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are so grateful,&#8221; chimed in Mrs. Standish,
managing to inject just a little recognition of the Divine
into her tone. &#8220;She has a wonderful voice. In
Munich she once sung the Forest Bird music in a performance
of <i>Siegfried</i>. Just think! One of our own
townswomen, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>She cast a vitreous beam athwart the table as she
spoke. Caine used to say that when Mrs. Standish&#8217;s
glasses diffused that look, he was always sore tempted
to bow his head and murmur &#8220;Amen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; prattled the Saint, &#8220;hers is a heaven-sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
gift. I believe that singing may often bear a message&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easier, I should think,&#8221; put in Caleb, suddenly
finding his tongue as he set down his empty wine glass,
&#8220;for a woman to sing like a forest bird than for a
bird to sing songs made up by humans.</p>

<p>&#8220;F&#8217;r instance,&#8221; he proceeded, with renewed courage,
mistaking the general hush of surprise for a gratifying
interest, &#8220;there&#8217;s a lady I know here in Granite
who has a canary bird that sings all about the death
of Ase. Sings it fine, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty giggled.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are a Grieg fiend, like so many other Granite
people just now, Mr. Conover?&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; Caleb exclaimed, in genuine astonishment,
&#8220;No, indeed, ma&#8217;am. I leave dope of all sorts
alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a laugh. Caleb did not quite see the
point, but felt dimly that he had scored a hit. Caine
came to his rescue.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a pity the bird couldn&#8217;t have been pressed
into service for the musicale,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;It
would be a real comfort to hear the &#8216;Death of Ase&#8217; in
new form.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he don&#8217;t sing all of it,&#8221; amended Caleb. &#8220;He
just sings the first part. I forget quite how it goes.
But he does it fine. Only, to my mind,&#8221; with an air
of profound criticism, &#8220;he sings it kind of sprightly
for such a sad piece. Still, I s&#8217;pose that&#8217;s a matter of
taste.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>Conover felt he was getting on finely. A most
flattering attention&mdash;far different from the slight
aloofness of the evening&#8217;s earlier moments&mdash;greeted
his every word. Caine, however, seemed actually
jealous of his friend&#8217;s popularity; for he cut in now
with a complete change of subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he conjectured, addressing no one in
particular, &#8220;why tenors invariably are born without
intelligence. When Providence gives a man a great
tenor voice, He gives him nothing else. Perhaps,
though, he needs nothing else.&#8221;</p>

<p>But an avalanche of trite sayings could not have
halted Caleb. He listened with ponderous deference
to Caine; then glanced about the table and cleared his
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speaking of &#8216;needin&#8217; nothin&#8217; else,&#8217;&#8221; said he, &#8220;reminds
me of Old Man Wetherwolks who used to live
at Pompton when I was a kid. He used to get jagged
as reg&#8217;lar as pay-day came &#8217;round. Had a battin&#8217;
av&#8217;rage of seven nights a week. Then when he&#8217;d
blowed his last nickel he&#8217;d make us boys pilot him
home. It wasn&#8217;t any cinch, either. For his wife was
always waitin&#8217; at the door. An&#8217; the chunks of language
she&#8217;d hand out to us would a&#8217; fried an iceberg.
One night, I remember, we brought the ol&#8217; sot home
worse&#8217;n usual. She was right there with the tongue-lashin&#8217;.
She told him what a swine he was to spend
all his fam&#8217;ly&#8217;s cash on booze and how he was a disgrace
to his town, an&#8217; other nice comfortin&#8217; things like
that. She wound up by screechin&#8217;: &#8216;An&#8217; you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
haven&#8217;t a single redeemin&#8217; trait, you worthless drunkard!&#8217;
That was too much for Wetherwolks. He
c&#8217;lapsed on the bottom step and began to cry.
&#8216;You&#8217;re right, m&#8217;dear,&#8217; he whines. &#8216;Ev&#8217;ry word you
say is true. I <i>haven&#8217;t</i> a single redeemin&#8217; trait. But,&#8217;
an&#8217; here he throws his chest out an&#8217; looks stern an&#8217;
noble, &#8216;But in ev&#8217;ry <i>other</i> respec&#8217; I&#8217;m a dam&#8217; fine
man!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The anecdote somehow did not &#8220;go&#8221; as well as
when Conover had told it in the back room of Kerrigan&#8217;s
saloon. But if there was constraint in its reception,
he did not observe it. Letty, dropping her
voice, to shut him out of the general talk, inquired:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Pompton? I don&#8217;t think I ever heard
of it. Did I? Are our Pompton Avenue and the
Pompton Club named for it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;It&#8217;s a little
place, &#8217;way up in the North Jersey hills. Swarmin&#8217;
with commuters, by now, I s&#8217;pose. I used to live
there for a while, once, when I was learnin&#8217; railroadin&#8217;.
There&#8217;s a lake, with the soft green hills all closin&#8217;
down around it like they loved it. The sun used to
set &#8217;bout a mile from our house. It&#8217;d turn the lake
all gold color. An&#8217; then a blue sort of twilight would
roll up through the valley. An&#8217; the hills would seem
to stretch out like they was goin&#8217; to sleep.&mdash;Kind o&#8217;
pretty place,&#8221; he ended lamely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a poet!&#8221; the girl assured him with gushing
uneasiness. &#8220;I had no idea you looked at nature
through such roseate glasses.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>&#8220;Neither I do,&#8221; he replied, ashamed of his unwonted
flight of fancy. &#8220;I was only tellin&#8217; you how
it used to seem to me when I was a half-baked kid.
Since then I&#8217;ve been so busy <i>livin&#8217;</i> that I&#8217;ve lost all the
knack of gettin&#8217; enthoosed over measly lan&#8217;scapes.
They don&#8217;t mean anything to me now. As for po&#8217;try,&mdash;honest,
I never wrote a rhyme in my life. Never
read one neither when I could help it. Guess you was
stringin&#8217; me, weren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless he was inwardly flattered at her praise
and began to look on her with an even more favoring
eye. If marriage in such a set were really the keystone
to social achievement, he felt he might do far
worse than choose this comely, quivering-nosed damsel
at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fond of rabbits?&#8221; he asked&mdash;as unintentionally
as irrelevantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What an odd question!&#8221; she cried, her round eyes
raising incipient distress signals. &#8220;Is it a joke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered, floundering, &#8220;I&mdash;I just happened
to say it. You&mdash;you look just a little like
one. A very pretty one of course,&#8221; he supplemented
with mammoth gallantry.</p>

<p>Her eyes, this time, hoisted the distress signal so
perceptibly that Caine, skilled to read the signs, broke
off in the midst of a sentence to his right-hand neighbor
and engaged Caleb in momentary conversation.
Letty, in the interval, stared appealingly about the
board. But, thanks to her own success in drawing
Conover into <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, the others were not, at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
instant, noticing either of them. Thrown upon herself
for comfort, she decided the rough guest had intended
his asinine remark as a compliment. The
thought did much to console her. She glanced, sideways,
at him, with a new interest; and, Caine, relieved,
saw the &#8216;Fair Weather&#8217; standard flying once more.</p>

<p>But Conover, subtly aware of her emotion, knew
he had somehow blundered. He saw how far he had
deflected from his original plan of stony self-control.
He knew it was the few glasses of wine he had drunk
which, while in no way befuddling his brain, had
given his tongue an undue looseness. A wave of self-contempt
passed over him; sharp, unaccustomed. A
manservant bent to fill one of his glasses. Caleb,
recalling the etiquette-book maxim, clapped his
hand hastily over the top of the goblet. The gesture
was sudden and carried with it an unintended
force. The wrought stem of the thin Venetian glass
snapped.</p>

<p>Conover, purple with angry mortification, surveyed
the wreck he had wrought. Then, pulling himself
together, he looked about the board, the glare behind
his forced grin challenging any and every eye that
might dare to show derision.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter, Mr. Standish!&#8221; he called down
the table to his host. &#8220;I&#8217;ll save the pieces and send
you a whole set like it to-morrow. Where&#8217;d&#8217;you buy
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is of no consequence at all,&#8221; returned Standish,
the consumption spots on his cheek bones burning a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
little darker red than usual. He turned to the neighbor
with whom he had been talking, and with his usual
dry cough took up the shattered thread of conversation.
But Caleb was resolved not to permit his overtures
at restitution to be slighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d you buy it?&#8221; he repeated, raising his
voice a little, &#8220;I want to know so I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is of no importance at all,&#8221; protested Standish,
guiltily avoiding his sister-in-law&#8217;s saintly gaze.
&#8220;I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I want to know,&#8221; persisted Caleb. &#8220;Where&#8217;d
the glasses come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; smiled Standish with a painful effort at
careless good-nature, &#8220;I believe they&#8217;re some we
picked up in Venice once. But they&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll send there for &#8217;em, then,&#8221; promised
Caleb, his defiant glance once more sweeping the oval
of faces.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, everyone seemed to be talking at
once, and no one seemed to be looking either at him or
at Standish. In cool, level, unhurried tones they were
speaking; these denizens of an unknown world, into
whose presence he fought his way unasked, unwanted.
Their language was not his language; their thoughts
were not his thoughts. They were moving on as if
he did not exist. Caleb remembered having read in
some newspaper&#8217;s &#8220;reprint&#8221; column, how an oyster
calmly glazes over the grain of irritating sand that has
found unwelcome refuge within its shell. He felt
humiliatingly like the nucleus of such a pearl. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
with the thought, and the waning of the wine&#8217;s effects,
came wholesome anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got more cash than the whole crowd of &#8217;em
put together,&#8221; he told himself fiercely.</p>

<p>The reflection did much to build up his wobbling
self-esteem. But, for the rest of the meal, he sat
glum. After an endless, dreary aeon of time, Mrs.
Standish&#8217;s eye-glasses flashed to the others of her sex
the signal to retire. Everyone rose. The women,
collecting from the men beside them the handkerchiefs,
fans and other feminine accessories that strewed the
floor under the table, filed out, chatting and laughing.
Caleb, not minded to seem inferior to any man by
hanging back and giving precedence to others, left the
room at the heels of the last woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Conover!&#8221; called Caine, as the Fighter&#8217;s
shoulders vanished through the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to ask you something about Steeloid
Preferred, if you don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; continued Amzi.</p>

<p>A backward look told Conover that the men were
re-seating themselves. He also saw the meaning of
his mentor&#8217;s summons. At that moment Caleb came
nearer feeling gratitude toward Caine than ever he
had felt it for any man. He slouched back, unconcernedly;
lighted a cigar, shook out his match and
dropped into the vacated chair at Caine&#8217;s left. Mentally
he resolved to tear the etiquette book, leaf from
leaf, for failing to warn him that men outstay women
in a dining room. But, with characteristic calm, he
refused to be ruffled by the mistake.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>&#8220;What was it you wanted to ask me?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;About Steeloid,&#8221; repeated Caine, &#8220;and about a
rumor I heard that the Rogers-Whitman Company
is&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let us talk business,&#8221; growled Conover, &#8220;I
never talk shop when I&#8217;m out in s&#8217;ciety. It&#8217;s bad
form. I&#8217;d rather chat just now &#8217;bout music.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was himself again; loudly self-assured.</p>

<p>&#8220;This feller, Back, they were speakin&#8217; about at
dinner to-night,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;I&#8217;m kind o&#8217; rusty on
op&#8217;ras, lately. So I&#8217;ve lost track of him. Is he composin&#8217;
much, nowadays?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bach has been de-composing for a couple of centuries,&#8221;
answered Caine.</p>

<p>One or two men laughed. Caleb waxed glum once
more. Nor could the combined tact of Caine and
their host draw him again into speech.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Fighter, glowering in a corner, watched the
stream of musicale guests trickle in through the great
double doors. He was lonely, cross, disappointed.
He could not define his own sensations, nor see how
nor wherein he had failed. Failure he had met. He
knew that. But the knowledge made him the more
determined to persist in his assault until the social
citadel whose outworks he had stormed, should be
his. And, the more he thought, the more his amorphous
idea of entering that citadel under a wife&#8217;s
aegis began to take definite shape. He found his gaze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
straying to where Letty Standish stood laughing and
talking with a knot of newcomers. Once his eye
caught hers, and she smiled. A polite, deprecatory
smile that strengthened Caleb&#8217;s growing resolution.
After all, he reflected, one might do worse than to
marry.</p>

<p>An indefinable something swept across his busily-planning
mind, like a breath of May through a slum.
Even before he raised his eyes eagerly to the door, he
knew that Desir&eacute;e Shevlin had come into the room.
Slender, dainty, infinitely pretty, in her soft white
dress, the sight of her struck athwart Caleb&#8217;s senses;
scattering to the winds every thought but delight at
seeing her,&mdash;pride in the way she bore herself among
the people in whose presence he felt so ill at ease.</p>

<p>And she had seen him. Seen him and noted his
discomfiture, his aloneness; even while she was responding
to her hosts&#8217; welcome. As soon as she
could leave Mrs. Hawarden&#8217;s side, she moved toward
him. As he advanced to meet her, the labored grin of
festivity wherewith Caleb had sought to wreathe his
features for her benefit, gave way to a glow of boyish
pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, but you&#8217;re dandy to look at in those clo&#8217;es,
Dey!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t a one in the room
who&#8217;s a patch on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled up at him in frank joy at the compliment.
Then, looking more keenly into his face, she
murmured, her pretty brows knit:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>&#8220;You poor, <i>poor</i> boy! You&#8217;ve been having a <i>horrid</i>,
hagorous time! What have they been doing to
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>In her voice was a vehement, motherly note; as of
indignation against the ill-treatment accorded a loved,
deficient child. Caleb felt it and it was as balm to his
scratched sensibilities. But he laughed loudly as he
made shift to reply:</p>

<p>&#8220;What a crazy notion! They treated me fine an&#8217;
I&#8217;ve had an out o&#8217; sight time. Honest, I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Caleb!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They made me quite one of &#8217;em,&#8221; he bragged,
the more earnestly for her unbelief. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t had
such a good time in a couple o&#8217; years. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Caleb Conover! Look me in the eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was rotten!&#8221; he admitted ruefully; his defense,
as ever, breaking to pieces before the onslaught of her
sweet imperiousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it!&#8221; she made answer; but there was no
triumph in her words, &#8220;I knew how it would be.
Oh, if only I could have been here to take care of you,
you poor lamb among social lions! Listen to me!
You&#8217;re not to stir from my side all evening. Understand?
Now mind me! <i>I</i> am going to see that nobody
is woozzey to you or lets you stand all frumped
up alone in a corner any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; spoil your own good time?&#8221; snorted Caleb.
&#8220;Not much! You chase on an&#8217; get talked to an&#8217; made
much of, you little girl! An&#8217; I&#8217;ll get all the fun I
want, watchin&#8217; the hit you make. <i>That&#8217;s</i> no lie.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather be with you, if you don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; she
insisted, &#8220;We&#8217;re chums, aren&#8217;t we? Well, then,
mind me and do as I say! We&#8217;re going to stay right
together.&#8221;</p>

<p>For some unknown reason, Caleb felt happier than
he had for days. He was ashamed of the feeling, but
so strong was it that he made no further demur. People
were starting for the music room. Piloted by Desir&eacute;e,
(who managed to make it perfectly clear to
divers and sundry youths, en route, that she was quite
content to remain with her present escort) Conover
found himself at last, enthroned on a maddeningly uncomfortable
camp-stool; with the girl at his left side.</p>

<p>The musicale opened with a long, intricate piano
solo; played with splendid persistence by a short young
man with long hair. The night was hot. The
bright-lit, overcrowded room was hotter. Caleb had
eaten largely and had drunk more than was his wont.
There is something very soporific, to the Philistine
outlander, in a rendition of ultra-classical music long
sustained. Conover shook himself impatiently to
scare off the drowsiness that threatened to enmesh
him. Desir&eacute;e glanced at him with merry encouragement
as the tireless pianist&#8217;s last reluctant note was
followed by a ripple of civil applause. The clapping
and Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s look combined to bring Caleb&#8217;s drowsy
senses back to normal wakefulness.</p>

<p>&#8220;That chap,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;can&#8217;t play anywhere
near as good as you do. Lord, but he did hit that
old pianner some cruel ones! After he&#8217;d tired it all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
out, too; so it couldn&#8217;t get back at him. I bet them
keys wish they had <i>your</i> white little fingers pettin&#8217;
&#8217;em instead of that blacksmith&#8217;s. What&#8217;s this next
turn goin&#8217; to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A tenor solo,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;It&#8217;s the &#8216;Siciliana&#8217;
from <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i>. Oh, good! It&#8217;s to
be accompanied by the harp. It always ought to be, I
think. Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; responded Caleb, with an air of loyal
certainty.</p>

<p>But Desir&eacute;e was too much engrossed in the prelude
to admonish him.</p>

<p>A few staccato chords; then began the song. At
first, repressed floridity of phrase; then passion bursting
starkly through the convention of stilted word
and melody; rising at last to a crescendo where speech
failed and a hot-gasped &#8220;<i>A&mdash;ah!</i>&#8221; broke off the
strain.</p>

<p>To Caine, listening impassive on the other side of
Desir&eacute;e from Conover, the air conjured up its picture
as vividly as though the scene lay before his eyes.
Gray dawn in the gray-walled Sicilian village, high on
the mountain top. Gray dawn of Easter, above the
sleeping hamlet. One figure half hidden by the abutting
angle of the stone houses, the only human being
abroad. One figure,&mdash;a man, guitar in hand, singing
that mad love song beneath the casement of the
woman he had won&mdash;lost&mdash;and wrongfully won
again. Turiddu, the returned soldier, serenading
Lola, fickle wife of Alfio, the absent teamster; Alfio<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
under whose knife-thrust Turiddu was destined to
fall, before the yet unrisen sun should stand at high
noon above their sordid little village world. And,
contemptuous of his half-foreseen fate, the wooer
was singing to the woman whose love was to bring him
death.</p>

<p>Mad, undisciplined, lawless adoration now moaned,
now cried aloud, in both air and words. What mattered
the holy day, the avenging husband&#8217;s steel, the
forsaken Santuzza, who was sobbing alone somewhere
in that huddle of blind houses? Love was king. The
pirate love who knows its stake is death; and, unafraid,
tempts its fate.</p>

<div class="verse"><i>Ma di restarci a me non me n&#8217;importa!&#8221;</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>Then in a last burst of gloriously insane protestation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>&#8220;Si per te muojo e vado in Paradiso,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Non c&#8217;entro se non vedo il tuo bel viso!&#8221;</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>And that yearning, wordless passion-fraught cry
wherein supreme longing rushed beyond the bounds
of speech.</p>

<p>A rumbling mutter of the harp-strings. And
silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sublimated howl of a back-fence tom-cat!&#8221;
muttered Caine, to himself; the garish brain-picture
fading.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>A momentary, tense hush fell over the audience as
the final chords trailed off into nothingness. Then,
before the utter stillness could be broken by the burst
of ensuing applause, another sound&mdash;hideously distinct,
vibrant, long-drawn,&mdash;cut raggedly through the
breathless quiet. The sound of a full-lunged, healthy
snore.</p>

<p>Caleb Conover was sleeping like a child.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>MOONLIGHT AND MISTAKES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The musicale was over. The first floor of the
Standish house looked as though a devastating army
had camped there. Caine, who had lingered for a
goodnight word with Letty, glanced over the empty
music room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if there is anything else on
earth quite so vacant as the place a crowd of guests
have just deserted. They always seem to have carried
away with them whatever local atmosphere there
was and to have left behind a vacuum of desolation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty did not answer. She was tired, nerve-worn,
relaxed, after the evening&#8217;s strain. Characteristically,
she was aware of a mild desire to make someone
else uncomfortable. Someone who cared for her
enough to be hurt. Caine suited her purpose to perfection.
Hence the sheath of grieved silence that always
brought him hastening to the anxious seat. The
ruse prevailed now, as ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t unhappy about anything, are you,
dear?&#8221; he queried solicitously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; she replied, a throaty quaver in her
voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>&#8220;<i>I</i> haven&#8217;t done anything, have I?&#8221; came the second
stereotyped question in love&#8217;s catechism.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>no</i>!&#8221; she returned briefly with full feminine
power of making the answer read, &#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But <i>what</i>?&#8221; he begged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing!&#8221; with the rarified loftiness that precedes
a plunge into the vale of tears, &#8220;Nothing!
Nothing at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nor was it until he had rung all the traditional
changes on the query and had worked himself into a
state of pitiable humility that she would consent to
burst forth into the flood-tide of her grievances.</p>

<p>&#8220;You made me so unhappy,&#8221; she wept. &#8220;It was
all your fault. <i>Why</i> did you do it? How <i>could</i>
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please&mdash;<i>please</i> tell me!&#8221; he urged. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
understand. How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That disgusting man! That brute you brought
here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Conover? <i>I</i> didn&#8217;t bring him. Your father&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is your friend, though,&#8221; she insisted, &#8220;And
he frightened me and he behaved so abominably.
And everybody laughed when he went to sleep. I
could have died of mortification.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221; he reasoned. &#8220;<i>You</i> weren&#8217;t responsible
for him. If anyone had cause to feel mortified
it was Miss Shevlin who sat beside him. Yet
she&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t talk about her!&#8221; demanded Letty
with a flash of watery dignity, &#8220;I have enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
bear without that. If she chose to sit up, looking
unconcerned, and talking to him as if nothing had
happened, and keeping the brute wide awake and interested
all the rest of the evening&mdash;it was probably
because she knew no better. I suppose her sort of
people&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And here the gods deprived Amzi Nicholas Caine
of wisdom.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a little thoroughbred!&#8221; he interposed
stoutly, &#8220;I never saw anything better done in my
life than her treatment of that poor, sheepish, suddenly-awakened
chap. It made one ashamed of having
wanted to laugh. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are going to take other people&#8217;s part
against me,&#8221; sniffed Letty, &#8220;you needn&#8217;t trouble to
wait here any longer. Goodnight. I am very tired
and <i>very</i> miserable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caine forthwith performed prodigies of self abasement
that little by little wooed Letty back from tears
to temper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the same!&#8221; she snapped. &#8220;It <i>was</i> your
fault. If it hadn&#8217;t been for you, I&#8217;m quite sure Father
would never have invited him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard of your father&#8217;s sacrificing his own
wishes to that extent for my sake,&#8221; said Caine, unwarily.
&#8220;If he invited Conover out of compliment to
me, he didn&#8217;t think it important enough to tell me so.
Shall I thank him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; cried Letty in alarm. &#8220;And,&#8221; with
recovering self-control, &#8220;I never want to see that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
man again as long as I live. I feel&mdash;<i>strangled</i>&mdash;when
he is near me. As if he were trying to master
<i>me</i> as he does his railroads and legislatures. He
hypnotizes me, with his mud-colored eyes and that
great lower jaw. I&mdash;I <i>hate</i> him. I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll never
have to see him again, <i>will</i> I? Promise me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Punishment had given place to a demand for coddling.
Caine rose ardently to the occasion. Yet she
was not content.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Promise me!</i>&#8221; she reiterated, &#8220;Promise me he&#8217;ll
never come here again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll have to pay a dinner call,&#8221; protested Caine.
&#8220;Even Conover knows enough to do that, I&#8217;m afraid.
If he doesn&#8217;t, Miss Shevlin will tell him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t be at home!&#8221; she declared, fearfully, &#8220;I&mdash;he
can&#8217;t <i>make</i> me see him. I never want to see
either of them again. <i>Either</i> of them. Promise me
I needn&#8217;t. Promise me you&#8217;ll thrash him if he annoys
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She peered coyly up at him from between thin,
soaked lashes; her nose quivering. But, for once,
loverlike heroics were lacking. For, even as he
started to voice the idle promise, a picture of Blacarda,&mdash;smashed
and unrecognizable, screaming in agony of
terror&mdash;flashed into Caine&#8217;s mind. And the pardonable
boast stuck midway in his throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you are getting tired of me,&#8221; sobbed Letty,
accusingly. &#8220;If you are, don&#8217;t be afraid to say so.
I can bear it. It&#8217;s only one thing more for me to
bear.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>Mrs. Hawarden, at Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s whispered plea, had
offered Caleb a homeward lift in her carriage. The
Fighter sat in heavy silence throughout the drive.
When the carriage stopped at Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s door, he helped
her out and, with a grunt of goodnight to Mrs. Hawarden,
followed the girl up the walk. Nor did he
speak as he unlocked the door for her.</p>

<p>But Desir&eacute;e was in no haste to say goodnight. A
waning moon made the veranda bright. The air was
still warm. She threw her cloak over a chair arm
and seated herself in a porch rocker; Caleb standing
dumbly before her. She leaned back comfortably in
the deep chair, looking up with inscrutable eyes at his
silhouette that bulked big in the moonlight. Of a
sudden, she fell to laughing softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you big baby!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You&#8217;ve punished
yourself all you&#8217;re going to. It&#8217;s <i>all</i> right.
Now stop being unhappy! Stop! <i>Smile!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t sore on me?&#8221; he asked in lingering
doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silly! Why should I be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I made awful small of you, the way I acted,&#8221;
he confessed.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can stand it, <i>you</i> ought to,&#8221; she retorted.
&#8220;Now be friends and stop sulking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure you ain&#8217;t mad,&#8221; he queried, still in
doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mad? Not one smidgin!&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Dey,&#8221; he interrupted, all contrition. &#8220;It was
<i>rotten</i> of me! To think of my snorin&#8217; out loud an&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
makin&#8217; everybody rubber at you while they gave me
the laugh! An&#8217; you never batted an eye! You sat
there lookin&#8217; so friendly an&#8217; cool, an&#8217; talkin&#8217; to me
like nothin&#8217; had happened! I could a&#8217; knelt down and
kissed both your feet, I kep&#8217; a&#8217; thinkin&#8217; all evenin&#8217;
that you&#8217;d most likely take it out on me when we was
alone. It&#8217;d a&#8217; been only hooman nature if you had.
That&#8217;s why I came here now. To take my medicine.
An&#8217; you ain&#8217;t even disgusted with me. You <i>ain&#8217;t</i> are
you?&#8221; he added in hasty need for reassurance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you have been &#8216;disgusted&#8217; with <i>me</i>,&#8221; she
asked, &#8220;if it had been I instead of you that&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know blame well I wouldn&#8217;t!&#8221; he declared,
&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;d a&#8217;licked ev&#8217;ry man in the place that dared to
laugh or look sneerin&#8217;. I&#8217;d a&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I wanted to do,&#8221; said Desir&eacute;e.
&#8220;If I was cross inside, it wasn&#8217;t at <i>you</i>, dear boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll win out on &#8217;em yet,&#8221; growled Conover. &#8220;I
made a mistake. An&#8217; I&#8217;m ashamed of it. The only
feller who&#8217;s never ashamed of his mistakes is a
loonatic. And I ain&#8217;t a loonatic, by a long shot. I&#8217;m
ashamed. But I&#8217;ll win.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me!&#8221; she demanded, &#8220;If there was a
big, lovable, splendid child you knew and he insisted
on going to play with children who hadn&#8217;t the sense
to see how fine he was and what good company he
could be, it wouldn&#8217;t make you angry at <i>him</i>, would it,
if he got laughed at for not understanding their stiff,
set ways? Of course not. But when he&#8217;d <i>had</i> his
lesson and had burned his poor stubby fingers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
wouldn&#8217;t it make you just the least little bit impatient
if he began right away to plan to try his luck with
those same horrid children again? Wouldn&#8217;t you
be tempted to spank him or&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re dead right, little girl,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;An&#8217;
you&#8217;re a lot cleverer than I am. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you <i>will</i> give it up?&#8221; she urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t, Dey! Honest, I can&#8217;t. I couldn&#8217;t look
myself in the face again if I let those gold-shirters
beat me out. You see how it is, don&#8217;t you? I&#8217;m in
to <i>win</i>. If I ever was to give up a fight, I could never
win another. It&#8217;d take the &#8216;win&#8217; out of me, for
keeps. <i>Please</i> don&#8217;t make me do it, Dey!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; she sighed, in comic despair, &#8220;It&#8217;s
only for your own sake and because I care for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s goin&#8217; to make you unhappy or ashamed of
me, I&#8217;ll give it up,&#8221; he said with slow resignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she forbade. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t feel that way
about it. It doesn&#8217;t make me unhappy, except on your
account. And I couldn&#8217;t be &#8216;ashamed&#8217; of you if I
tried all day. You know I couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the dandiest, littlest, prettiest girl there
is!&#8221; he said gratefully, &#8220;An&#8217; those big eyes of yours
kind of make me feel like I was in church. Now I&#8217;ll
chase home an&#8217; give you a chance to do some sleepin&#8217;.
Say&mdash;&#8221; as he started to go, &#8220;What do you think of
Miss Standish?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; she answered, perplexed, &#8220;I never thought
much about her. She&#8217;s very nice;&mdash;and pretty, too;
isn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>&#8220;Looks a little like a rabbit, don&#8217;t she?&#8221; he ventured.</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s quick laugh flashed out and she clasped
her hands together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beautiful!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;How did you <i>ever</i> think
of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Struck me the first time I saw her,&#8221; he replied,
flattered, &#8220;I told her about it to-night at dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Caleb! You <i>didn&#8217;t</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Honest, I did!&#8221; he reiterated. &#8220;I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>did</i> she say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she didn&#8217;t seem to mind. Got sort o&#8217; red, an&#8217;
grinned. I guess she liked it. Her&#8217;n me didn&#8217;t get
on so bad together, takin&#8217; all into account. I guess
we&#8217;ll pull together first rate when we&#8217;re better
acquainted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem pretty certain of being &#8216;better acquainted&#8217;&#8221;,
she mocked; albeit there was a little tug
at her heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; he answered, coolly, &#8220;The fact is, Dey,
I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; of makin&#8217; it a case of marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment she did not answer. The footfalls of
a pedestrian sounded rhythmically distinct in the silence
that fell between the man and the girl. Then Desir&eacute;e
observed, with a slight restraint that sat strangely
upon her:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that is a very nice joke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t a joke at all,&#8221; Caleb assured her, &#8220;I mean
it. I&#8217;d a&#8217; talked it over with you before, only the idee
never came clear to me till to-night. Here&#8217;s how it
is&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>&#8220;You&mdash;you care for her?&#8221; asked Desir&eacute;e very
quietly. Caleb, full as he was of his own aspirations,
noticed how dull and lifeless her voice had all at once
grown.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re tired out!&#8221; he cried, all remorse, &#8220;Here
I keep you up, listenin&#8217; to my fool talk when you
ought to be sound asleep! Nice sort of guardian I
am! I&#8217;m goin&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Wait!&#8221; she ordered, with a pitiful shadow
of her wonted dainty imperiousness, &#8220;I&#8217;m not tired.
Tell me. Are you in love with her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In love with her?&#8221; scoffed Caleb. &#8220;With that
little rabbit-faced bunch of silliness? Not me! But
she comes of about the biggest fam&#8217;ly here. She&#8217;s
pop&#8217;lar ev&#8217;rywhere. If I was to marry her, I&#8217;d get
with the best crowd in Granite. My place&#8217;d be as
sure as yours&#8217;ll be when you marry that gold-shirt
chap&mdash;whoever he turns out to be&mdash;that we was
talkin&#8217; about the other day. I was speakin&#8217; of the
idee to Caine, only to-night, an&#8217; he says&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Oh!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The furious monosyllable snapped through his rambling
talk like a pistol shot. Caleb paused in amaze.
The girl had risen. Her tiny fists were clinched, her
face was hard as a statue&#8217;s. The moonlight gave back
cold fire from her great eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you?&#8221; she panted, &#8220;How <i>dare</i> you!
You speak of marrying Letty Standish as you would
speak of buying a horse! You even talk it over with
the man she has promised to marry! But I suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
you chuckled to yourself over your barroom cunning
in getting an opinion from him without letting him
know it was <i>his</i> sweetheart you planned to steal. You
sneer at her as a &#8216;rabbit-faced little bunch of silliness&#8217;
and yet you speak in the same breath of making her
your wife. Do you realize you are not only insulting
her by such a thought, but you are insulting <i>me</i> by
speaking so in my presence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Dey!</i>&#8221; gasped the bewildered man, &#8220;You must be
crazy, child! I never saw you like&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be still!&#8221; she commanded, her silver voice ringing
harsh, &#8220;I forbid you to speak to me, now or any
time. A man who can plan what you are planning,
and who can boast of it, isn&#8217;t fit to speak to <i>any woman</i>.
You went to that house as a guest&mdash;and you asked
mens&#8217; opinions in the smoking room&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the dressin&#8217; room, Dey,&#8221; he pleaded, &#8220;An&#8217;
it was only me an&#8217; Caine&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ask mens&#8217; opinion,&#8221; blazed on Desir&eacute;e, unheeding,
&#8220;as to whether you are likely to gain anything
in a social way by wrecking an innocent girl&#8217;s
life. You sit by her at dinner&mdash;at her own father&#8217;s
table&mdash;and plan in smug complacency how to separate
her from a man she really loves,&mdash;and to compel
her to marry <i>you</i>. Why, you aren&#8217;t fit to marry
her chambermaid. There isn&#8217;t a groom in her stable
that hasn&#8217;t higher, holier ideals. Now <i>go</i>! This is
the last time I want to see you as long as I live!&#8221;</p>

<p>A swirl of soft skirts, the sharp slam of a door,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
and Caleb Conover, aghast, wordless with dismay
stood alone on the little moon-lit porch.</p>

<p>For a full minute he stood there, dumbfounded.
Then, from somewhere in the darkness beyond the
closed door, came faintly the sound of sobbing.
Rending, heartbroken sobs that brought a lump to his
own throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dey!&#8221; he called, frantically miserable, &#8220;Dey!&#8221;</p>

<p>He tried the locked door, and rapped as loudly as
he dared upon its panels. The sobbing died away.
For an hour Conover waited; alternately whispering
the girl&#8217;s name and tapping appealingly for admittance.
But the house remained silent. At length with a
despairing growl he turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now what in blazes could a&#8217; made her act like
that?&#8221; he pondered, half-aloud. &#8220;Gee, but I&#8217;d
rather be horsewhipped than make that kid cry! An&#8217;
I s&#8217;pose,&#8221; he went on as he passed out of the gate, &#8220;I
s&#8217;pose &#8217;bout this time Letty Standish an&#8217; Caine are
sayin&#8217; goodnight, all slushly like, an&#8217; grinnin&#8217; at each
other, like a couple of measly love-birds.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked back once more at the dark house; sighed
noisily, and started homeward. A passing policeman
recognized him; and, in deference to the Fighter&#8217;s fast-growing
political power, so far unbent as to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evenin&#8217;, Mr. Conover. Fine night, ain&#8217;t it?
Are&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, go to hell!&#8221; snarled Caleb.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />


<small>CALEB CONOVER TAKES AN AFTERNOON OFF</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The Fighter made life a burden, next day, for the
office staff of the C. G. &amp; X. An electric aura of uneasiness
pervaded the big station&mdash;the indefinable,
wordless something that gives warning to the most
remote denizens of every office when the &#8220;boss&#8221; is
out of temper.</p>

<p>Yet Caleb, as it happened, was not out of temper.
He was merely unhappy. The effect, to casual observers,
was the same as on the not very rare days of his
rages. But, instead of storming up and down his office
as on the latter occasions, Caleb merely sulked in his
desk chair, chewed countless cigars, and roused himself
every few minutes to make toil a horror for such luckless
subordinates as just then chanced to impress
their existence on his mind. Hence the President&#8217;s
private office was shunned like a pest-house by everyone
who could avoid going thither.</p>

<p>The office boy, official martyr of the day, shook
visibly as he sidled into the room, about three that
afternoon, and laid on his chief&#8217;s desk a sealed, unstamped
envelope. Conover&#8217;s scowl vanished as he
noted the handwriting. The office boy breathed
deeper and his knees grew firm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>&#8220;Any answer?&#8221; asked Conover; and for the first
time since his arrival his voice sounded scarcely more
menacing than that of a sick bear.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir!&#8221; piped the youth with a propitiatory
grin. &#8220;I ast the mes&#8217;nger an&#8217; he said&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clear out!&#8221; mumbled Caleb, his eyes and mind
fixed on the sheet he had clumsily withdrawn from
the envelope.</p>

<p>The boy departed; swaggering into the main office
with all the conscious heroism of a lion-tamer. The
door, wind-caught, swung shut behind him with a slam
that turned swagger into helpless panic. But no
dreaded voice howled a reprimand through the panels.
Caleb Conover was reading and re-reading a few
scribbled lines in exaggeratedly large writing. The
Fighter&#8217;s face softened as he read. Then, glancing
about in shame-faced caution, he hastily lifted the
note; brushed it across his lips with a furtive, yet careless
mien; as though the gesture might have been employed
to cover a yawn. Contemptuous of the first
covert loverly deed of his career, he cleared his throat
and for the sixth time read the scrawled words. Half
audibly, he perused them; smiling to himself.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<i>Please, I&#8217;m good now. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m EVER
going to be bad again. Wouldn&#8217;t it be fine if you
should come and take me for a walk this afternoon?
D. S.</i>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she the dandiest ever?&#8221; Caleb asked himself
gleefully as he straightened his tie before the office<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
mirror and jammed his felt hat down over his forehead,
&#8220;Why can&#8217;t the Letty girl be like her? Then
there&#8217;d be some pleasure in gettin&#8217; married. Hope
she and Dey&#8217;ll be friends. If they ain&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He strode through the outer office, looking so human
that his expression, combined with the far more
important fact that he was evidently departing for the
day, put the whole staff into the utmost good humor
for the rest of the afternoon.</p>

<p>It was a very natural, self-controlled Desir&eacute;e who
met Conover on the porch of the Shevlin cottage.
If hers had been the muffled sobs that had sent him
home with a lump in his throat&mdash;if she had lain wide-eyed,
tortured, till broad daylight&mdash;there was no hint
of such excess in her flower face nor in the girlish
vigor of her pose. Conover, doubtful as to how he
might best refer to the quarrel of the previous night,
for once did an absolutely wise and tactful thing. He
made no mention whatever of the affair.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was such a gorgeous day,&#8221; Desir&eacute;e was saying,
&#8220;that I felt I ought to let you know what beautiful
weather it was. You&#8217;d never have thought to look,
for yourself. You know you wouldn&#8217;t. Now take
me somewhere. Anywhere, so long as it&#8217;s far enough.
And I want to walk; not drive. Where are we going?
It&#8217;s got to be somewhere outside of this squiffy, hot old
town. Out where there&#8217;s a whole sky-ful of air.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you like to walk out to the Arareek?&#8221; he
suggested, &#8220;We can sit on the stoop there and drink
seltzer lem&#8217;nade an&#8217; watch the paretics chase gutta<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
percha pills over the golf links. Would you care
&#8217;about doin&#8217; that? There&#8217;s a big view there for folks
that cares for that sort of rot.&#8221;</p>

<p>She assented gaily and they set off, walking close together
and chattering like a couple of schoolgirls on a
holiday. Caleb felt oddly young and buoyant. The
girl had ever the power of imparting to him, when
they were alone together, something of her own youth
and gaiety. To-day, the spell worked with double
force, because of last night&#8217;s scene. It would have
needed a far cleverer onlooker than Conover to detect
any artificiality in Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s high spirits. She bullied
him, petted him, cajoled and instructed him by turns
as was her wont, until they had entered the Arareek
grounds. Then of a sudden she fell silent.</p>

<p>The deep clubhouse veranda was filled with knots
of men and women. Among the idling groups, the
girl had recognized Letty Standish and Caine. Jack
Hawarden, who was sitting with the couple, ran down
the steps to welcome the newcomers.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are two extra chairs at our table,&#8221; he said
eagerly, &#8220;And I believe they&#8217;re the only two left on
the whole veranda. I wondered why no one took
them. Now I see it was providential.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caleb hesitated, glancing in doubt at Desir&eacute;e. The
girl, a little to his surprise, assented with perfect
willingness to Jack&#8217;s suggestion, and led the way
between several bevies of frankly admiring men and
openly curious women, toward the table where Caine
and Letty were seated. Miss Standish&#8217;s cheeks were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
flushed as she noted their approach. Nor did her
gentle face wear quite its best expression. But Caine,
masculinely obtuse, was very evidently glad to see
them. He signalled a waiter as Caleb and Desir&eacute;e
seated themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;When Providence ordained hot days like this,&#8221;
said Caine oracularly, &#8220;He mercifully devised seltzer
lemonades to go with them. Would you rather have
a Scotch-and-soda, Conover?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No thanks,&#8221; demurred the Fighter. &#8220;No use
in spoilin&#8217; two perfec&#8217;ly good things like booze an&#8217;
water by fizzin&#8217; &#8217;em up together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is so,&#8221; agreed Caine tritely, &#8220;Mixing whiskey
with water is like merging love into matrimony.
It&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty giggled appreciation. She had a marvellous
ear for humor, and could almost always tell by a
speaker&#8217;s tone when he had said anything funny. It
was a natural gift many girls envied her. In the midst
of the laugh she remembered Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s presence and
fell back on her defenses of gentle reserve.</p>

<p>Caine was hailed from another table and went
across to reply to some question. Jack, too, was for
the moment, leaning over to speak with someone on the
lawn below. Caleb, left alone between Desir&eacute;e and
Letty, racked his brain for something to say. For
once, Desir&eacute;e did not help him. She was gazing out
with dreamy joy at the beautiful grounds; her eyes
resting longest on the stately avenue of trees that
wound up to the house. Thus it devolved upon Letty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
to save the conversational ship from utter wreck.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly thought to see you here, Miss Shevlin,&#8221;
she observed with a graciousness that did not however
leave the second personal pronoun quite unaccented.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Desir&eacute;e, simply. &#8220;I hear some
really very nice people come here,&mdash;sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I meant I feared you would hardly feel at
home,&#8221; persisted Letty, walking round-eyed toward
destruction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Desir&eacute;e assured her, with a child-like
smile. &#8220;At home I never see men sit with their feet
on a veranda rail. And I never see women drinking
whisky there, either,&#8221; she added with a glance toward
a nearby table whither a tray of high-balls had just
been borne.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder you came, then,&#8221; sputtered Letty, with
a despairing effort at cold reproof.</p>

<p>&#8220;One goes anywhere nowadays,&#8221; replied Desir&eacute;e.
&#8220;And besides,&#8221; she sighed raptly, &#8220;I <i>love</i> the country.
Everything about it always has a charm for me.
From trees like those splendid old oaks, down to&mdash;&#8221;
her eyes swept the scene for an antithesis; accidently
resting for the remotest instant on Letty&#8217;s profile as
she finished, &#8220;down to the funny little rabbits with
their ridiculous round bodies and bulging, scared
eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; groaned Caleb to himself, glancing helplessly
from one girl to the other, &#8220;It must be <i>hell</i> to be
a Mormon!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>For a moment, Letty pondered on Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s harmless
speech.</p>

<p>Then, all at once, a queer, gurgling little sound rumbled
far down in her throat and she slowly grew pink.
Her nose quivered a mute appeal to all mankind.
Caine mercifully returned at this juncture. All unconscious
of the smouldering fires, he proceeded, man-like,
to stir up the coals.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have made one more of an endless line of
conquests, Miss Shevlin,&#8221; he announced, &#8220;General
Greer,&mdash;Miss Standish&#8217;s uncle, you know,&mdash;called me
over to his table expressly to ask who you were; and
to demand, in lurid diction, why he had never met
you before. He is coming over here in a moment, if
you&#8217;ll permit, to be introduced to you. You don&#8217;t
mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course not,&#8221; said Desir&eacute;e in sweet
effusion, &#8220;Miss Standish knows how glad I am to
meet anyone connected with her. By the way, she
and I have been raving over the joys of country life.
We&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty was saved by the advent of an elderly man,
apoplectic of mien, stumpy of gait, who hobbled across
to their table and greeted her with a bluff manner he
had spent many busy years in mastering. Then, without
waiting for her reply, he nodded to Jack and
looked expectantly toward Caine. The latter rose to
the occasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Shevlin,&#8221; he said, trying to make the act<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
seem bred of an unexpected meeting, &#8220;May I present
General Greer?&#8221;</p>

<p>The General bowed low; his best old-world air and
his corpulence battling doughtily for supremacy in the
salutation. He was about to follow up the bow with
some remarks of a fatherly yet admiring nature, when
Caine, with malice aforethought, broke in:</p>

<p>&#8220;And, General, may I introduce Mr. Caleb Conover?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man&#8217;s honeyed words collided with a snort
that sprang unbidden from his throat; resulting in a
sound that was neither old-world or fatherly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Conover, eh?&#8221; he rapped out. &#8220;Heard of you,
sir! Heard of you!&mdash; Too often, in fact. You&#8217;re
the fellow that&#8217;s always buying up our legislators,
aren&#8217;t you? Why do you do it, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because they&#8217;re for sale,&#8221; said Caleb, unruffled.
&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s &#8217;bout the only reason I&#8217;m able to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean to accuse the men who represent our
interests at the Capital,&mdash;to accuse them of being
willing, untempted, to sell their vote?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t go so far as that,&#8221; answered Caleb
with a tolerant grin. &#8220;They ain&#8217;t <i>all</i> waitin&#8217; for
chances to sell their vote. Some of &#8217;em prefers to
rent it out by the year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want me to believe such a libel on our
statesmen?&#8221; declaimed Greer. &#8220;On the men we&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not exactly coaxin&#8217; you to believe <i>anything</i>,&#8221;
replied Caleb, pleasantly, &#8220;An&#8217; I ain&#8217;t liable to lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
wake nights moanin&#8217; because you doubt it. If the
people didn&#8217;t want to be run by a lobby, they wouldn&#8217;t
be. That&#8217;s all there is to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t come to discuss ethics with a man of your
stamp,&#8221; sneered the General. &#8220;But I can tell you
you are wrong&mdash;<i>wrong</i>, sir&mdash;in thinking the people
will always stand such conditions as you and your
kind are thrusting upon them. Only yesterday one of
my clients was telling me that if he could not curb
your legislative influence by fair means he would&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to you for help?&#8221; finished Caleb blandly.</p>

<p>General Greer stared at him speechless, apoplectic.
Letty, who, despite years of sharp contrary experience,
still clung to the fond delusion that she was the
spoiled-child-niece of fiction who could twist an otherwise
crotchety uncle about her finger, now intervened
with one of her inspired blunders. The General&#8217;s
rumbling voice had drawn attention to their table and
Miss Standish conceived a plan of pouring oil on the
thundrous waters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Uncle Guy!&#8221; she pouted prettily, &#8220;You&#8217;ll
make Mr. Conover think you&#8217;re in earnest in the
dreadful things you are saying to him! It&#8217;s just dear
Uncle Guy&#8217;s bluff way, Mr. Conover, that he picked
up when he was commanding soldiers in the army.
He&#8217;s really a darling old lamb, if only&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>After one long, dumb glare of annihilation at his
self-appointed spoiled-child-niece, the darling old lamb
stumped away, bleating blasphemously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; conjectured Desir&eacute;e, looking up from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
her tall glass, &#8220;why seltzer lemonades make such
squizzy sounds through the straw when the glass is
almost empty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s a hint,&mdash;&#8221; observed Caine, glancing
about for a waiter.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Only a scientific comment.
Oh, it <i>is</i> good to be in the country a day like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be in the country for the summer, this time
next month,&#8221; said Jack Hawarden, &#8220;Mother&#8217;s taken
the same cottage at the Antlers we had last year. It
will be nice to get back to the old Adirondacks again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Adirondacks?&#8221; exclaimed Desir&eacute;e. &#8220;Oh,
take me along. I&#8217;ve always wanted to go there!&#8221;</p>

<p>Letty, pained at a suggestion so palpably immodest,
looked in frightened appeal to Caine. But Amzi
was once more talking to people at the next table.
So Miss Standish drew around her an aloofness that
lifted her high above any ribaldry that might be
bandied about her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve never been?&#8221; asked Jack in surprise,
&#8220;You&#8217;ve missed a lot. There&#8217;s no other region just
like the Adirondacks. It rains about a third of the
time, as a rule. But when it&#8217;s clear you forget it can
ever be anything else. The breath goes down a mile
deeper into your lungs than it can in any other part of
the world; and you never get tired. A sort of perpetual
ozone jag. Almost any place there is worth
going to. We generally hang out at the Antlers,&mdash;Mother
and I. Up on Raquette Lake, you know.
It&#8217;s different from other places. It&#8217;s run by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
Charlie Bennett, a giant of a man as broad as Mr.
Conover and half a foot taller. He and Father are
old chums from the time when it took three days to
get into the wilderness and when you could shoot
Adirondack bear for breakfast any morning. Bennett
used to be Father&#8217;s guide in those days. Now, I
suppose he could buy and sell Dad half a dozen times
over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>wish</i> I could go there&mdash;or anywhere at all in
the Adirondacks,&#8221; sighed Desir&eacute;e wistfully. &#8220;I read
once&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Caleb noted the longing inflection and made quick
mental memorandum of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;How big&#8217;s your cottage, Jack?&#8221; he asked the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Four rooms. We get our meals at the hotel.
Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothin&#8217;!&#8221; Continuing with elephantine
humor, &#8220;Though maybe I might drop in on you sometime.
How many of you goin&#8217; to be there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father can only stay a month this year. After
that there will be only Mother and I. Did you really
think of joining us? We&#8217;d be ever so glad. There&#8217;s
an extra room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much obliged. I&#8217;ve never took a vacation yet, an&#8217;
I guess I&#8217;m a little bit too old to begin. I don&#8217;t
b&#8217;lieve in vacations. Neither would you if you could
see how my clerks look when they get back from &#8217;em.
The first day back, you&#8217;d think they was beginnin&#8217; a
life sentence in prison. It costs &#8217;em six months&#8217; savin&#8217;s
to grow a bunch of callous spots on their hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
an&#8217; tan on their faces that they could a&#8217; got free of
charge, workin&#8217; in my freight yards. When d&#8217;you
expect to go to the country, Miss Standish?&#8221; he
broke off, remembering belatedly his new-chosen role
of attentive swain, and turning unexpectedly upon
Letty before she had an opportunity to resume the
aloofness which she had just discarded as unnecessary.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t quite know yet,&#8221; she made reply, unreasonably
scared by his sudden glance, &#8220;We shall
probably stay in town rather late this year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; approved Caleb. &#8220;I hope we&#8217;ll see a lot
of each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, looking into his light, masterful eyes, the girl
knew all at once that she would not have the wit nor
the force to avoid him. The knowledge turned her
sick. Her round, helpless gaze shifted involuntarily
to Desir&eacute;e, as the nearest woman to her. And, under
the genuine fright behind that appeal, the steel glint
that had of a sudden hardened Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s big eyes,
softened unaccountably. A quick sentence that had
risen to her lips died unborn.</p>

<p>For a moment, before convention could lower the
veil, the two women read each other to the very soul.
At what the brief glance told her, Letty drew her
breath with a sharp intake that made Conover glance
at her inquiringly. To cover her confusion, Miss
Standish plunged into speech on the first subject that
crossed her mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you didn&#8217;t mind Uncle Guy&#8217;s rudeness,
Mr. Conover,&#8221; she began, &#8220;He really doesn&#8217;t mean
half the cross things he says. He suffers so dreadfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
from dyspepsia and&mdash;and there are sometimes
family troubles, too, that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; assented Caleb, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard. Married
a wife that was too rich for him. She don&#8217;t always
agree with him, I hear, an&#8217; I s&#8217;pose it gives him mental
indigestion. No offence. I forgot they&#8217;re rel&#8217;tives of
yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, just the same, that he spoke so threateningly
to you,&#8221; went on Letty.</p>

<p>She found it so easy to talk to him now. A weight
seemed off her heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Threats don&#8217;t keep me guessin&#8217; very much,&#8221; Conover
reassured her, delighted at her new ease of bearing
toward him, &#8220;No one&#8217;s goin&#8217; to do a rich man
any real harm or hold grouches against him. To him
that hath, it shall be forgiven. That&#8217;s in the Bible,
ain&#8217;t it? Or somethin&#8217; like it. The trouble with men
like your uncle is that they don&#8217;t see any farther
ahead than twenty years ago. Business an&#8217; pol&#8217;tics
have changed a lot since then. But the old crowd
don&#8217;t see it. They&#8217;re like a feller that rows a boat.
They move ahead because the boat carries &#8217;em ahead.
But they&#8217;re always facin&#8217; astern.&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt he was talking amazingly well. He was
almost annoyed when Desir&eacute;e, having sat in troubled
silence for some minutes, rose abruptly and proposed
that they should go.</p>

<p>Letty Standish, watching them depart, was saying
over and over to herself in a rapturous sing-song:</p>

<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t <i>let</i> him make love to me. She won&#8217;t!
She <i>won&#8217;t</i>!&#8221;</p>

<small>CALEB CONOVER LIES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>One morning, a week or so later, Caine strolled into
Conover&#8217;s private office. Under the young newspaper
owner&#8217;s customary jauntiness was a hint of something
more serious. Conover, as skilled in reading men as
he was ignorant in deciphering any problem relating
to woman, was aware, at a glance, of the subtle
change.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; he said, nodding to his secretary to go,
&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? If you&#8217;re scared because Steeloid
fell off three-quarters of a point yesterday, you can
rest easy. I did it myself on &#8216;match&#8217; sales; and a
few others&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t Steeloid,&#8221; said Caine, &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing that
really concerns me. But I thought you would want
to know about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire away, then,&#8221; vouchsafed Caleb, &#8220;Have a
cigar? These with the gold-an&#8217;-red life belts are nice
to look at. But if you want something that tastes
better&#8217;n it looks, try one of the panatelas. The ones
without illustrations on &#8217;em. Now what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about Miss Shevlin,&#8221; began Caine, with reluctance.</p>

<p>Conover&#8217;s massive calm fled. He brought down his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
crossed legs from the desk corner with a bang and
whirled his chair about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak it out, quick!&#8221; he ordered sharply. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t
sick, is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. This is different. You&#8217;ve heard of Ex-Governor
Parkman&#8217;s plan to start an anti-graft crusade,
of course?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; grinned Caleb, &#8220;Them croosades are as
certain as measles. Ev&#8217;ry city goes through &#8217;em ev&#8217;ry
once in so often. They don&#8217;t do any real hurt and
they can&#8217;t tie up <i>my</i> bus&#8217;ness so&#8217;s to bother me any.
Let &#8217;em croosade till they&#8217;re black in the face. It&#8217;ll
be good for you noospaper fellers, an&#8217; it won&#8217;t harm
anybody it&#8217;s aimed at. But,&#8221; uneasily, &#8220;what&#8217;s that
got to do with Dey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming to the point if you&#8217;ll give me a chance.
Parkman&#8217;s preparing a set of tables showing not only
how municipal funds are squandered at present but
how they were misspent in the past. In the course of
his investigations, he has come to the City Hall and
the County Court House.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; queried Conover, &#8220;What then? Both
of &#8217;em was built ten years ago. That&#8217;s over an&#8217; done
with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Shevlin Contracting Company did the work,&#8221;
interpolated Caine.</p>

<p>&#8220;What of that? Neither building&#8217;s caved in, has
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet. Though, if all Parkman claims is true,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
I don&#8217;t know why they haven&#8217;t. He came to me this
morning with the whole story. Proofs, affidavits and
all. He wants to give the <i>Star</i> first chance to publish
the exposure. I told him to come back at noon,
and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What exposure?&#8221; asked Caleb in perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems he took pains to hunt up the original
specifications on both buildings,&#8221; resumed Caine,
&#8220;And then he hired an architectural expert to go
over the plans and the work and see how the two
agreed. Thus far, he has found cheap foundations
and sandstone bedding where the best concrete and
granite were called for. Stucco has been used in no
less than four corridors where the plans called for
marble. The &#8216;solid marble pillars&#8217; on the east portico
are &#8216;composition,&#8217; shells filled with cement.
Then the facade&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, son,&#8221; interrupted Conover with perfect sincerity,
&#8220;what in blazes is the matter with you and
Parkman? You&#8217;ve bit into a mare&#8217;s nest, an&#8217; any
practical man&#8217;ll tell you so. Of course a contractor&#8217;s
goin&#8217; to make what he can on a job. He ain&#8217;t in the
business for his health or to endow the city, is he?
He&#8217;s got to get his, an&#8217; the pol&#8217;ticians who throw the
job to him have got to get theirs. An&#8217; that bein&#8217; so,
how&#8217;s he goin&#8217; to foller out all the arch&#8217;tect&#8217;s spec&#8217;fications
an&#8217; still make the right money out of it? He
<i>can&#8217;t</i>. I thought ev&#8217;rybody knew that much pol&#8217;tics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Conover,&#8221; observed Caine, in unwilling admiration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard people say you&#8217;re a man of bad
morals. It isn&#8217;t true. You&#8217;re simply a man of no
morals at all. Do you mean to say&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean to say business is business an&#8217; pol&#8217;tics is
business too. I never heard of any good comin&#8217; from
mixin&#8217; up morals with either of &#8217;em. If you came
here to-day to tell me this story, with an idee that I&#8217;d
slap my manly brow an&#8217; say: &#8216;Great heaven! Can
such things be?&#8217; you&#8217;ve brought your s&#8217;prise party to
the wrong house. Of course, Shevlin made a good
thing out of those two buildin&#8217;s. Even after the folks
higher up had got their rake-off, I guess he must a&#8217;
cleaned up close to $800,000. An&#8217; then the old fool
went an&#8217; blowed it all in Wall Street, an&#8217; died before
he could make a new pile. But, say! What&#8217;s this
got to do with&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With Miss Shevlin? I am coming to that.
This &#8216;mare&#8217;s nest,&#8217; as you call it, that Parkman has
unearthed, may look harmless to you and to other
practical business-politicians. But to nine people out
of ten it will have very much the look of bare-faced
robbery. So much so that it will prove the biggest
newspaper sensation of the year. Mr. Shevlin will be
everywhere spoken of as&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I catch your meanin&#8217;!&#8221; broke in Caleb, &#8220;The
&#8216;Holier&#8217;n Thou&#8217; crowd will raise a yell, drag Shevlin
out of his snug, comf&#8217;table grave an&#8217; croocify him.
He&#8217;ll be spoke of by the papers an&#8217; by the man on the
street as the rottenest grafter of the century. An&#8217;
ev&#8217;rywhere Dey goes, folks&#8217;ll nudge each other an&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
whisper: &#8216;Them fine clo&#8217;es was bought out o&#8217; the
dough her ol&#8217; man stole from the city.&#8217; An&#8217; all the
time there&#8217;s no less than a dozen cases of city graft
goin&#8217; on in Granite to-day that are raw enough to
make Shevlin&#8217;s deals look like a game of Old Maid!
Still,&#8221; he muttered, dropping his head on his chest in
thought, &#8220;all that won&#8217;t keep this story from queerin&#8217;
Dey in s&#8217;ciety and givin&#8217; her a black eye as the daughter
of a crook.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I put off Parkman till I could see
you,&#8221; explained Caine, &#8220;He came direct to me with
the news. It&#8217;s lucky I happened to be in town. If
he had gone to my managing editor instead, there
would be a scare-head Extra on the streets by now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; returned Conover, &#8220;the story&#8217;s got to be
hushed up, of course. An&#8217; I hate to pay hush-money.
But I guess this is one of the times when it&#8217;s got to be
done. I wonder what&#8217;s Parkman&#8217;s price?&#8221;</p>

<p>Caine laughed, mirthlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Parkman&#8217;s as rich a man as you are,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;And he&#8217;s so upright that he bends backward. He
would like nothing better than to prove attempted
bribery against you. No, the adage about &#8216;every man
having his price&#8217; won&#8217;t apply in Parkman&#8217;s case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rot!&#8221; growled Conover. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t a case on
earth where it won&#8217;t apply. The price ain&#8217;t always
money; but it&#8217;s always dead sure to be <i>somethin&#8217;</i>.
Only, I ain&#8217;t got time, I s&#8217;pose, to find out what Parkman&#8217;s
partic&#8217;lar rates are. I wish I had. If I&#8217;d had
wind of this a week earlier I&#8217;d have been able by now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
to lay my finger on his pet weakness or fav&#8217;rite sin or
cash price an&#8217; say &#8216;Shut up!&#8217; An&#8217; he&#8217;d a&#8217; done it,
quicker&#8217;n greased lightning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re mistaken,&#8221; averred Caine. &#8220;But that has
nothing to do&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it has nothin&#8217; to do with this muddle we&#8217;re
in now,&#8221; snapped Conover, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t sayin&#8217; it has.
But Parkman has his price just the same, if only we
could find out what it is. There never was but one
Man that hadn&#8217;t. An&#8217; that was why they put Him
to death. What do you want for keepin&#8217; the story
out of the <i>Star</i>?&#8221; he ended, abruptly.</p>

<p>Caine&#8217;s handsome face contracted in sudden wrath.
Then, in spite of himself, he broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;If only you <i>knew</i> better,&#8221; he sighed in comic resignation,
&#8220;you&#8217;d be horsewhipped three times a week.
What a mighty, impregnable armor is profound ignorance!
Unfortunately,&#8221; he went on, more gravely,
&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t avail myself of your very tactfully veiled
offer even if I chose. The <i>Star</i> is but one of Granite&#8217;s
four daily newspapers. If I refuse to print the
story, the three others remain to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221; mused Conover. &#8220;I s&#8217;pose so. I s&#8217;pose
so. In another five years there won&#8217;t be a paper in
Granite that&#8217;ll dare print a word I tell &#8217;em not to. I
wish now I&#8217;d bought up their stock already; instead
of waitin&#8217; until I get some more important deals off
my hands. A noospaper is a good weapon for a big
man to keep for emergencies. If &#8217;twasn&#8217;t for the
papers I could a&#8217; pulled off lots of dandy schemes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
What a cinch the old-time business men must a&#8217; had
before printin&#8217; was invented!&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice trailed away. His head once more sank.
His eyes were shut; his forehead contracted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought it only fair&mdash;&#8221; began Caine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; grunted Conover, &#8220;I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;.
Leave me be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caine, in no wise offended, held his peace, and
watched the big concentrated figure that sprawled so
motionless in the desk chair. For several minutes
the two sat in silence. Then Caleb opened his eyes.
The frown had cleared; the light of battle flickered
beneath his shrewd lids.</p>

<p>&#8220;Caine,&#8221; he said solemnly, &#8220;I got a confession
to make. You&#8217;re the first to hear it. So be flattered.
Caine, Ol&#8217; Man Shevlin had nothin&#8217; to do with the
Shevlin Contractin&#8217; Company, at the time the City
Hall an&#8217; the County Courthouse was started. Six
months before then, he&#8217;d sold out the whole business
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on a second,&#8221; ordered Caleb. &#8220;Hear all
the sad, sad secret before you fly up in the air. I
bought out the Shevlin Contractin&#8217; Com&#8217;pany, lock,
stock an&#8217; bar&#8217;l; good will an&#8217; fixtures. I still ran it
under Shevlin&#8217;s name, so&#8217;s to get the good of his old
trade. That&#8217;s why I worked through agents. <i>I</i>
didn&#8217;t appear in it at all. I built the Court House an&#8217;
the noo City Hall, an&#8217; made close onto a million out of
the deal. It was crooked work if you like. But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
statoot of limitations&#8217;ll keep me from bein&#8217; indicted
for it, I guess. An&#8217; if I am indicted, I&#8217;ll bet fifty
dollars to fifty doughnuts the case&#8217;ll never come to
trial. Yessir, I&#8217;m the guilty man, all right. An&#8217; I
can prove it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you quite through?&#8221; asked Caine with exaggerated
politeness, as the Fighter paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep. That&#8217;s &#8217;bout all. Good story for the papers,
hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An excellent story&mdash;for the horse marines,&#8221; retorted
Caine. &#8220;Really, Conover,&#8221; he continued almost
plaintively, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see what overt acts of idiocy
I have ever committed that you should offer so vile
an insult to my intelligence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye mean?&#8221; queried Caleb with bland
innocence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean, every word of that rigmarole is a thread
in one of the clumsiest tangles of lies I have ever had
the misfortune to listen to. I thought better of your
inventive powers!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t believe me?&#8221; exclaimed Conover, aggrieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not lucky enough to have had the Chess
Queen&#8217;s training in &#8216;believing at least three impossible
things before breakfast every morning,&#8217;&#8221; misquoted
Caine. &#8220;Really, Conover, did it never occur
to you that telling an unnecessary lie is almost tempting
Providence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The story&#8217;s true,&#8221; persisted Caleb, doggedly,
&#8220;Just like I told it to you. I owned the Shevlin Contractin&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
Comp&#8217;ny. Shevlin had been out of it six
months. I was the one that did the graftin&#8217; when
the two buildin&#8217;s was put up. An&#8217; I ain&#8217;t ashamed
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caine looked long, quizzically, into the light, alert
eyes that so brazenly met his.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really believe you mean to stick to it,&#8221; he said
at last. &#8220;But why? And don&#8217;t you see that a single
glance at the records will disprove it all? If Shevlin
really transferred his business to you, there would be
a record of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be a record&mdash;if it&#8217;s needed,&#8221; countered
the Fighter, &#8220;That the easiest part of it all. But
it won&#8217;t be needed. My say-so will be b&#8217;lieved for
once. Folks won&#8217;t s&#8217;pose a man would accuse himself
of bein&#8217; a crook if he was reelly on the square.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do as you please,&#8221; replied Caine impatiently, &#8220;but
don&#8217;t keep up the farce with <i>me</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; assented Caleb with cheerful acquiescence,
&#8220;I won&#8217;t, if it jars you. But that&#8217;s the story
that&#8217;s goin&#8217; out under my name. An&#8217; you&#8217;re the man
who&#8217;s goin&#8217; to help me. Now, listen to me, an&#8217; be sure
you get my instructions right. An&#8217; don&#8217;t butt in with
any objections. Because I need you to help me. If
you don&#8217;t, some other paper will. May as well get a
&#8216;beat&#8217; for the <i>Star</i>. Besides, you know I can help
folks sometimes who helps me. There&#8217;s other deals
besides Steeloid. Will you stand by me? Is it a
go?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Fighter&#8217;s tone had deepened to a growl that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
held more menace than appeal. His eyes were fixed
in scowling command on his visitor&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;This cringing attitude of yours touches me to the
heart,&#8221; said Caine; speaking lightly, though he felt
the other&#8217;s magnetic domination throughout his entire
being, &#8220;What do you want me to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you,&#8221; dictated Conover, &#8220;to go back to
your office and send for your best reporter. Don&#8217;t put
this up to your managin&#8217; editor, but handle it yourself.
The reporter will work a lot better when he
thinks it&#8217;s a story the owner&#8217;s int&#8217;rested in. That&#8217;s
workman-nature, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; smiled Caine, fighting against that
merciless domination which found expression in the
man himself, not in his words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Send for your best, sharpest reporter,&#8221; resumed
Caleb, &#8220;Give him an outline of this case against old
Shevlin. Tell him to spread himself on it. As a
starter, tell him Shevlin an&#8217; me used to be friends, an&#8217;
suggest that he&#8217;d better chase around here first of all
an&#8217; interview me, to find out if I ever heard of the
graft trick that was worked on those two public buildin&#8217;s.
I never let reporters get in here; but I&#8217;ll make
an exception in this case, &#8217;cause he&#8217;ll bring a pers&#8217;nal
note from my pers&#8217;nal friend, Amzi Nicholas Caine,
Esquire. I&#8217;ll talk to him kind of guarded-like. But
pretty soon I&#8217;ll get rattled under his questions, an&#8217; let
out enough to put him on the right track. Then when
I see he&#8217;s s&#8217;picious, I&#8217;ll give in an&#8217; tell him the whole
thing, an&#8217; exonerate ol&#8217; Shevlin to beat the band.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
That reporter&#8217;ll feel like the man who went out for
squirrels an&#8217; brought home a bear. Then, when he
reports back to you, I want you should be firm in your
dooty to the c&#8217;moonity. You must decide that pers&#8217;nal
friendship can&#8217;t stand in the way of the public&#8217;s
sacred right to find out things that&#8217;s none of their
business. Print the whole terr&#8217;ble trooth. Don&#8217;t
spare <i>me</i>. But see that you clear Shevlin&#8217;s name till
it shines like it had a Sat&#8217;dy night bath. An&#8217; <i>Dey&mdash;ain&#8217;t&mdash;to&mdash;be&mdash;mentioned</i>!
Understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly,&#8221; answered Caine, &#8220;And I&#8217;ll do nothing
of the sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;ye mean you&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean just this: You are the most conscienceless,
inhuman brute I ever met; but I have a sort of
morbid liking for you. Besides, as you so often take
graceful occasion to remind me, I am in your debt for
certain financial favors. Also, I have some regard for
the truth of what appears in my own newspaper. For
all those reasons&mdash;and for several more&mdash;I&#8217;m not
going to help you to commit social suicide, nor to
stamp yourself as more of a highwayman than you
really are. Is that plain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So plain that it&#8217;s plumb ugly,&#8221; replied Caleb,
&#8220;But you&#8217;ll do it just the same. If it ain&#8217;t the <i>Star</i>,
it&#8217;ll be one of the other papers. That story&#8217;s goin&#8217; to
be in print by to-morrow mornin&#8217;. You speak &#8217;bout
likin&#8217; me an&#8217; bein&#8217; in my debt. The best way
you can show that likin&#8217; an&#8217; gratitood is by doin&#8217; as I
ask now. The <i>Star&#8217;s</i> the best paper in Granite an&#8217; it&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
read by the best people. Don&#8217;t you s&#8217;pose I&#8217;d rather
have folks get their first idee of the story from such a
paper as that than to have &#8217;em see it plastered all over
the front page of some screechin&#8217; sheet, in letters two
feet high?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; argued Caine, &#8220;What sense is there in
doing it at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From a grown man&#8217;s point of view,&#8221; admitted
Caleb, &#8220;There ain&#8217;t a mite of sense in it. It&#8217;s straight
craziness. But if you think I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to let Dey go
around knowin&#8217; the trooth about her old crook of a
father who she worships, you&#8217;re wrong. She thinks
he was a measly saint with a tin halo. An&#8217; she gets
pleasure out of thinkin&#8217; it. An&#8217; she&#8217;s goin&#8217; to go right
on thinkin&#8217; it to the end of the game. What sort
of a yellow dog would <i>I</i> be to let her hear things
about him that&#8217;d make her cry an&#8217; that would sure
break her heart? There&#8217;s another thing: She&#8217;s got
into a good crowd now. She goes to folks&#8217; houses an&#8217;
has a good time there. Who&#8217;s goin&#8217; to invite a crook&#8217;s
daughter to their house? Or, do you think she&#8217;d go to
such places, knowin&#8217; how they thought of her father?
Not her. She&#8217;d die first. Why, ev&#8217;ry time folks
looked at her in the street, she&#8217;d be thinkin&#8217; to herself:
&#8216;It ain&#8217;t because I&#8217;m so pretty an&#8217; &#8217;cause my eyes look
like two chunks of heaven, an&#8217; &#8217;cause when I smile at
you it makes you feel as if someone had lent you
money.&#8217; She&#8217;d think: &#8216;They&#8217;re pointin&#8217; me out as
the daughter of Shevlin who stole cash from the city!&#8217;
No, no, son! She ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to have none of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
things happen to her. Not while Caleb Conover&#8217;s on
deck. Butterfly smashin&#8217; ain&#8217;t in my line. That&#8217;s
why I say you&#8217;ve got to help me. An&#8217; you&#8217;ll do it,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you know,&#8221; suggested Caine, &#8220;that
this will ruin those weird social ambitions of yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know nothin&#8217; of the sort. Even if I did, I s&#8217;pose
I&#8217;d have it to do just the same. But it won&#8217;t. I&#8217;m
too well off to go to jail; or to have folks say:
&#8216;Get out!&#8217; when I say &#8216;Let me in!&#8217; There&#8217;ll be a
sight of talk in the papers an&#8217; all through the State.
But folks get tired talkin&#8217;, after awhile. An&#8217; <i>I</i> never
get tired <i>risin&#8217;</i>. So I&#8217;ll win out. When I flash on
&#8217;em that merger of the Up-State R. R. with my C. G.
&amp; X., they&#8217;ll see I&#8217;m too big a man to be sat on. That&#8217;s
comin&#8217; off next week, by the way. An&#8217; bigger schemes
to foller. Oh, folks won&#8217;t be sore on me long! So
you see it ain&#8217;t such a great stunt of heroism I&#8217;m doin&#8217;
for the little girl after all. Now you&#8217;d better start.
For we&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Miss Shevlin? She will read what the papers
are bound to say of you. She will hear what her
friends&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; ruefully admitted the Fighter, &#8220;She will.
I&#8217;ll have to take my chances on that. If she drops me,
why it&#8217;s better&#8217;n if s&#8217;ciety dropped <i>her</i>. Better for
ev&#8217;rybody concerned. Unless maybe for <i>me</i>. How&#8217;s
Miss Standish?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite well, thank you. She&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been meanin&#8217; to come &#8217;round and pay that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
dinner call. But I&#8217;ve been pretty busy. An&#8217; Dey
says there&#8217;s no great hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just now,&#8221; answered Caine, remembering
Letty&#8217;s moist appeal, &#8220;The Standish household is a
little upset. I&#8217;d call sometime later, if I were you.
They will understand. Clive Standish is down with
mumps, poor little chap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only two kind of kids,&#8221; philosophized Conover,
&#8220;Bad ones and sick ones. But I ain&#8217;t afraid of
catchin&#8217; anything. I&#8217;ll be &#8217;round there in a day or
two, tell her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; remarked Caine, to change the subject
he found vaguely distasteful, &#8220;Miss Shevlin tells
me she has been invited to spend the summer at the
Hawardens&#8217; cottage at the Antlers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned Caleb, drily, &#8220;Kind of Mrs.
Hawarden, wasn&#8217;t it? Dey&#8217;s as pleased as a small
boy with a revolver. She&#8217;s been crazy to go to the
Adirondacks. I never knew she wanted to till last
week, or&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Mrs. Hawarden providentially invited her
the next day?&#8221; put in Caine, his mouth-corners
twitching.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; assented Caleb, &#8220;I guess some big-hearted
philanthrofist just took such a fancy to Mrs.
Hawarden as to pay the whole fam&#8217;ly&#8217;s board bill there
for the season;&mdash;on condition she asked Dey. But
keep that to yourself; for maybe it&#8217;s just a wrong
guess. An&#8217; I wouldn&#8217;t have Dey know it for a thousand
dollars. Now go an&#8217; send that reporter here.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; mused Caine, as he departed on his
queer mission, &#8220;what Caleb Conover would be if all
the rest of the world were like Desir&eacute;e Shevlin.
It&#8217;s more interesting, though,&#8221; he added, &#8220;to conjecture
what he would be like <i>without</i> Desir&eacute;e Shevlin.
Where would he stop, if she were out of his life?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />


<small>DESIR&Eacute;E MAKES PLANS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Next morning, the Granite <i>Star</i> made known to the
world at large that grievous wrong had been done to
the city and to its taxpayers when their two foremost
public buildings had been erected. These edifices,
hitherto the pride of Granite, were constructed of
cheap, inferior material: were ill-put together and
were, in short, a disgrace, a byword and a hissing.
The city and county had paid for first-class work.
They had received fourth-rate value for their money.</p>

<p>And the miscreant on whom the sole and total blame
rested was Caleb Conover, President of the revivified
C. G &amp; X. railroad. He, hiding behind the honorable
name of a man since dead, had robbed the city with
one hand and the county with the other. Now,
through the cleverness of a <i>Star</i> reporter, his culpability
was at last unearthed.</p>

<p>Further, the <i>Star</i> desired, editorially, to avoid needless
exploitation of scandal and the bringing to light of
misdemeanors for which there now appeared to be no
legal penalty. But it owed a duty to its constituents,
the thinking class of Granite. Perhaps Mr. Conover,
having, since the regrettable transactions, reared upon
such fraudulent foundations a fortune which was estimated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
as verging upon the two million mark, would
see his way toward making restitution.</p>

<p>To which quip of Caine&#8217;s the Fighter retaliated by
depressing Steeloid stock. This bit of practical repartee
led to a second editorial to the effect that what
was done was done, and that perhaps the wisest and
most dignified course would be to let the unfortunate
matter rest where it was. The lesser newspapers of
the town, having bayed with incredible loudness and
ferocity the moment the <i>Star</i> gave voice, now showed
inclination to follow the leader&#8217;s example in letting the
scandal die out.</p>

<p>There were no further developments in the case to
warrant continuous re-hashing of the story through
their columns. Ex-Governor Parkman, finding himself
and his crusade unceremoniously side-tracked by
this more interesting turn affairs had taken, sulked in
his tent. Caleb, after that first momentous interview,
would see no reporter. A new sensation was thoughtfully
provided by the assistant cashier of the Aaron
Burr National Bank who wandered one day from his
post of duty and neglected to return; taking with him,
in equal absent-mindedness, $18,000 of the bank&#8217;s
funds.</p>

<p>Caleb and his inspired confession, for all these excellent
reasons, were not even a nine-day wonder.
Within a week the volcano had subsided. The incident,
apparently, was closed. Whether or not the
Grand Jury would take steps toward criminal prosecution
remained to be seen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>At the end of the week, Caleb, in answer to a peremptory
summons, called on Desir&eacute;e.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have you been?&#8221; she catechised with the
air of an Angora kitten enacting the role of Rhadamanthus.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been busy,&#8221; he evaded, &#8220;Workin&#8217; on a new
deal we&#8217;re puttin&#8217; through, an&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know it is eight whole days since you have
been near me?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nine,&#8221; he corrected humbly. &#8220;I&mdash;I been busy,
an&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you haven&#8217;t called <i>anywhere</i> else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where else could I?&#8221; he asked in amaze.
&#8220;There&#8217;s only one place I expected to call. That&#8217;s
at the Standishes&#8217;. An&#8217; they&#8217;ve got mumps, there.
Besides, I kind of thought I&#8217;d wait until some of this
noospaper talk quieted down before I went anywheres.
That&#8217;s&mdash;that&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t come here, either,&#8221; he
went on, shamefacedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it!&#8221; she declared. &#8220;I <i>knew</i> that was it.
I wondered if you could be so utterly silly. So I
waited. And it seems you could. Aren&#8217;t you
ashamed? It would have served you right if I hadn&#8217;t
sent for you at all. <i>Why</i> didn&#8217;t you come, Caleb?
You surely don&#8217;t suppose all that newspaper nonsense
made any difference to <i>me</i>, do you? Now stop
looking at me as if I&#8217;d slapped you and promise not
to be so bad any more. Promise!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here!&#8221; blurted Caleb, at once relieved and
puzzled, &#8220;How was I to know you wouldn&#8217;t just about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
hate me when you heard how I&#8217;d acted about those
measly public buildin&#8217;s? An&#8217; your father&#8217;s comp&#8217;ny
too. Why, I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say you thought I <i>believed</i>
any of the absurd story?&#8221; she cried, incredulous.
&#8220;Why, Caleb Conover, I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was true!&#8221; he protested vehemently, &#8220;All
of it was true. It was me, an&#8217; not your father
that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was neither of you, if there was anything wrong
about the matter,&#8221; she decided with calm finality,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know business and I don&#8217;t know politics.
But I do know you and I knew Dad. And neither of
you could have done a low or dishonest thing if you
had tried all day. If the papers choose to twist your
business dealings upside down and try to make people
think either of you defrauded anybody,&mdash;why, so
much the worse for people who are stupid enough to
believe such falsehoods. That&#8217;s all there is about it.
I&#8217;ve seen cartoons of you garroting the city of Granite,
and I&#8217;ve read editorials that called you &#8216;Brute&#8217;
Conover and I&#8217;ve waded through columns of articles
abusing you. And it all made me angry enough to
cry. But not at <i>you</i>, you old chum of mine. At the
people who wrote such vile things and tried to make
the public believe them. Now let&#8217;s talk about <i>me</i>.
Are you glad I&#8217;m going away? Please be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I glad I&#8217;m not goin&#8217; to see you for more&#8217;n
two months?&#8221; corrected Caleb, &#8220;Not much I&#8217;m
not. It gives me the blues ev&#8217;ry time I think of it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>&#8220;But you <i>are</i> going to see me. I&#8217;ve thought it all
out, and I&#8217;ve got your orders ready for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say you&#8217;re not goin&#8217;?&#8221; queried
Caleb in dismay. &#8220;But you&#8217;ve got to, Dey. Just
think how much you&#8217;ve wanted to, an&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going,&#8221; she replied serenely. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
promised Mrs. Hawarden. And, besides, I wouldn&#8217;t
miss it for worlds. But you&#8217;re coming, too. Isn&#8217;t
that nice?&#8221;</p>

<p>She leaned back to watch his delight in her revelation.
But he eyed her without a ray of understanding.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;you&#8217;re going to take a
nice, long vacation in August or September and coming
up to the Antlers. I talked it over with Jack Hawarden
and it&#8217;s all arranged. There won&#8217;t be room
for you in the cottage, but you can get a tent or a
lodge within a stone&#8217;s throw of it; and we&#8217;ll have the
gloriousest time you ever dreamed of. Isn&#8217;t that
splendid? <i>Say</i> it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Dey,&#8221; he objected. &#8220;You don&#8217;t understand.
I never took a vacation in my life. I ain&#8217;t
got time to. This is goin&#8217; to be the busiest summer
yet, for me. I&#8217;ve a dozen irons in the fire. I&#8217;d like
awful well to come an&#8217; see you there, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve settled it all,&#8221; she replied calmly, &#8220;And
you&#8217;re coming. It will only be two weeks;&mdash;if you
can&#8217;t get away for longer. But you&#8217;re coming for
those two weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>can&#8217;t</i>, Dey. I&#8217;ve got&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>&#8220;Now, I suppose you expect me to be a lowly
squidge, and sigh and say &#8216;Oh, very well!&#8217;&#8221; she retorted.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m not going to do anything of the
sort. Listen: You&#8217;ve never had a vacation. Then
it&#8217;s time you took one. I&#8217;d be <i>ashamed</i> to be so inexperienced,
if I were you. You&#8217;ve got a lot of irons in
the fire. Very well then; you have two whole months
to get enough of them out to let you take a fortnight&#8217;s
rest. You&#8217;ve never gone <i>anywhere</i> with me, Caleb.
You&#8217;ve just been with me for an afternoon or an evening
when half your mind was on that wretched railroad.
Think of our being together for two gorgeous
outdoor weeks, with nothing to do but have all the
good times there are. And in the Adirondacks, too.
<i>Caleb!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d&mdash;I&#8217;d love to, Dey, if&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So then it&#8217;s all arranged!&#8221; she cried, happily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;I can&#8217;t. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I shall have to discipline you,&#8221; she sighed.
&#8220;I see that. I was afraid I&#8217;d have to. Look me in
the eyes! Now, say after me: &#8216;I promise to come to
the Antlers for a fortnight this summer.&#8217; <i>Say</i> it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;Why, Dey, I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t what I told you to say!&#8221; she broke in,
sternly. &#8220;Say it now. Slowly. &#8216;I promise to&mdash;&#8217;&mdash;Say it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I promise to&mdash;&#8221; he repeated in resignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to the Antlers for a fortnight this summer.
Say it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to the Antlers for a fortnight this summer,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
he groaned, &#8220;Lord! What&#8217;ll my work do, while
I&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Now</i> see how nice you are!&#8221; exulted Desir&eacute;e,
&#8220;You&#8217;re being good at last. Don&#8217;t you feel happier
now you&#8217;ve stopped being bad and obstinate? <i>Say</i>
so!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it make <i>you</i> happier?&#8221; he evaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it does. But,&#8221; she added, paying truth
its strict due, &#8220;of course I knew you were coming
anyhow. Now let&#8217;s talk about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But say,&#8221; he protested, &#8220;S&#8217;pose you an&#8217; your
aunt run down to Coney Island or Atlantic City after
you leave the Adirondacks; an&#8217; let me come down
there instead? There&#8217;s lots of fun to be had at those
places. But what can <i>I</i> do up in the woods? Just
measly trees an&#8217; sky an&#8217; water; an&#8217; not even a Loop
the Loop or a music hall, I s&#8217;pose. Gee! It&#8217;s too
slow for my taste.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it is my mission to improve your taste,&#8221; she
insisted, frowning down his amendment as unworthy
of note, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you <i>want</i> to like the things I like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered, obediently.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when you know it will give me twice as much
fun if you&#8217;re there with me, you&#8217;ll want to come to
the Adirondacks, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;d make any sort of a hit with you, Dey,&#8221; he
answered in full honesty, &#8220;I&#8217;d spend those two weeks
in a contagion ward. An&#8217; you know it. But what in
thunder is there to do, up in the wilderness?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>&#8220;We can go on camping trips, for one thing,&#8221; she
said eagerly, &#8220;and cook our own meals out in the
forest and sit around camp fires and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did all those things when I was workin&#8217; on the
section gang eighteen years ago,&#8221; interpolated Caleb,
&#8220;An&#8217; got one-eighty-five a day for doin&#8217; it. It didn&#8217;t
get much enthoosiasm out of me then. Maybe it&#8217;s
better fun though when you have to pay <i>ho</i>tel rates
for the priv&#8217;lege. Any more aloorments?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A <i>great</i> many,&#8221; said she coldly. &#8220;But I shall
punish you by not telling you any of them. You haven&#8217;t
seen Miss Standish since the day we went to the
Arareek Club?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered, too accustomed to her quick
changes of theme to see anything significant in the
careless question, &#8220;But I hope to see quite a lot of
her this summer. She&#8217;s stayin&#8217; late in town. An&#8217;
it&#8217;ll be lonesome for me after you&#8217;re gone. I guess
she an&#8217; I&#8217;ll get better acquainted before fall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You still have that&mdash;plan&mdash;you spoke of?&#8221; she
answered, speaking low and hurriedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; he answered, &#8220;I don&#8217;t let go of plans,
once I&#8217;ve took the trouble to make &#8217;em. I&#8217;ll let you
know how I come out. But there ain&#8217;t much doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>He checked himself, remembering all at once how a
similar vaunt had been received by Desir&eacute;e a few
weeks earlier. But now, to his covert glance of apprehension,
the girl&#8217;s delicate face showed no sign of
resentment. He noticed, however, for the first time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
that her aspect had but a shade of its usual fresh buoyancy;
that the soft rounded cheek was paler than was
its wont.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re lookin&#8217; all run down, Dey!&#8221; he cried, in
quick concern, &#8220;This hot weather&#8217;s hurtin&#8217; you. It&#8217;s
high time you went away to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she interrupted wearily, &#8220;It&#8217;s time I went
away.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />


<small>THE DUST DAYS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>July held Granite in a hot, dry grip that parched
the leaves and grass into a grayish green and with
every vagrant breeze set the dust devils a-dancing.</p>

<p>Almost everybody was out of town,&mdash;with the exception
of some nine-tenths of the city&#8217;s total population.
These unfortunate town-bound mortals
sweltered and sweated in office, store and cottage, or
sweltered and died in the network of mean streets beyond
the railroad tracks. Daily from the slums crept
slow lines of carriages, headed too often by a hideous
white vehicle which in grisly panoply was carrying
some silent child on its first trip to the country; there
to have the day of bless&eacute;d release from noise and
overcrowding marked&mdash;if the parents could scrape together
enough insurance money&mdash;with a white stone.
In gutter and alleyway of the tenement district
swarmed the gaunt little survivors. In doorways or
in shaded corners of roofs or in overcrowded bars
panted their elders.</p>

<p>The residence streets one by one had gone blind and
lay empty, fraught with a strange lifelessness. Ultra-exclusive
Pompton Avenue, its houses converted into
still mausoleums, baked under the merciless sun. Its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
lawns ran rank. From the wide thoroughfare itself
arose endless whirls of dust and the smell of boiling
asphalt. A few homes still wore the awnings and
veranda lattices of June; proclaiming the presence of
tenants who could not yet shake from their feet&mdash;or
from any other part of their grimed anatomies&mdash;the
dust of the city.</p>

<p>Caleb Conover, in his suffocating private office,
toiled on untiring. On his chilled steeled nerves and
toughened body, the heat hurled itself in vain. Coatless,
collarless, without waistcoat, his shirt neck wide
open, his suspenders hanging, he ploughed his daily
route through mountains of work; his worn out office
force plodding wearily in his impetuous wake. And
in these days of dust and scorching sun, Caleb was
indeed making hay, after his own fashion. To him
was due the fact that more Pompton Avenue residences
were open this summer than ever before. Men
who in social life were wont to look on him as a
pariah, were none the less jumping as he pulled the
commercial strings and were dancing to his music.
For Caleb, his slow lines at length laid out, was making
a general advance upon the financial defenses behind
which for years the staid business men of the
county had dozed in short-sighted security.</p>

<p>The first news of the attack came with the announcement
of his merger of two railroads&mdash;the
Broomell-Shelp and the Upstate&mdash;with the C. G. &amp;
X.; which virtually gave the last named road a monopoly
of state traffic. Stocks had been hammered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
down, share-holders stampeded by calamity-rumors,
and holdings bought in at panic rates by the Fighter.
Then had come reorganization and&mdash;presto! the C.
G. &amp; X. had benevolently assimilated its two chief
rivals. Men who had considered their railroad stock
as safe an investment as government bonds now stayed
in town for lack of funds to go away for the summer;
or else in order to seek eager alliance with the Fighter&#8217;s
swift-swelling interests. Pompton Avenue was
hard hit.</p>

<p>Nor was this the sum of Caleb&#8217;s warm weather activities.
There were other deals less widely blazoned,
yet quite as remunerative; deals that plunged so far
beneath the surface of practical politics as to emerge
black with the mire of the bottom. But it was gold-bearing
mud, and Caleb knew the secret of assaying
it. These submerged ventures brought at odd hours
to the stuffy private office a succession of slum-dwellers;
even as the mergers brought, at other hours,
the Pompton Avenue element. Long were the conferences
and deeply was the Underworld stirred
thereby. Thus, in the maze of hovels &#8220;across the
tracks,&#8221; as well as along the hill boulevards, did Caleb
Conover cause unwonted activity of a sort, during the
stifling days of dust.</p>

<p>Caine, remaining in town, more to glean in the path
of Conover&#8217;s sickle than to look after the interests of
his own newspaper, was moved to admiring envy.
The Steeloid deal which a few months earlier had
meant so much for both himself and Conover, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
now but a side issue with the latter; a mere detail
whose ultimate fate could not materially affect his fast
multiplying wealth. The campaign which for years
had been Caleb&#8217;s objective, was carried through now
with a rush and daring that led onlookers, who knew
not how long-devised was each seemingly wild move,
to catch their breath and wonder when the crash would
come. But the crash did not come. It would not
come. Conover could have told them that, had he in
these hot weeks of ceaseless rush possessed the leisure
and will to explain his lightning moves.</p>

<p>Blacarda, too,&mdash;emerging from retirement with
scarred face, a useless left arm and a heart black with
mingled dread, deathless hatred and an obsessed craving
for revenge,&mdash;Blacarda noted his foe&#8217;s sudden
triumph and yearned to the depths of his semi-Semitic
soul to turn in some way the Fighter&#8217;s flank. But, for
the moment, he was helpless. He could but set into
motion such few schemes of his own as seemed feasible;
and begin a course of underground counterplanning,
whose progress was by no means rapid enough
to ease the hate that mastered him. Meantime, he
kept out of the Fighter&#8217;s way. For, even yet, his
wrecked nerves thrilled treacherously at fear of physical
nearness to the brute who had broken him.</p>

<p>To Caine&#8217;s casual warning anent Blacarda, Caleb
gave no heed whatever. He had conquered the man
once. Should the need arise, he could do so again.
In the meantime he had no time to waste in following
his victim&#8217;s crawling movements.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>Great was Caleb Conover. He was fighting. He
had always been fighting. Just now, battle was as
the breath of his nostrils. For he was waging a winning
fight; warring and winning on a scale to which
he had never before been able to attain. And the
militant bulldog part of him was strangely elate.</p>

<p>But, when the hot night came, and the day&#8217;s warfare
was over, there would ever come upon Conover an odd
sense of emptiness, of lonely depression. More than
once, absent-mindedly, he caught himself planning to
banish the feeling by picking up his hat and hurrying
across to Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s home. Then, with a slight shock,
he would remember that Desir&eacute;e was in the Adirondacks
and that he was&mdash;alone.</p>

<p>He had always known the absent girl was necessary
to his happiness; that without her he was a loveless,
unlovable financial machine. But now he realized
with a sick ache at his heart how utterly he had grown
to depend upon her actual presence&mdash;on the constant
knowledge that she was near. When this, his first
clumsy effort at self-analysis, had been worked out,
Caleb laughed at himself for a fool. But there was
as little merriment in the laugh as with most mortals
who seek to evoke self-amusement from the same
cause.</p>

<p>It was in one of these desolate moods, after a
twelve-hour day&#8217;s ceaseless work, that it occurred to
Conover one evening to call on Letty Standish. He
had not for a moment abandoned his idea of making
her his wife. But that would come in due time; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
meanwhile he had been busy with matters that could
not be so readily postponed. True, he had at last paid
the deferred dinner call. But Miss Standish, the butler
had said, was not at home. Twice he had repeated
the visit, and both times had been met by the
same message. This did not strike him as at all
peculiar. In summer, people were apt to be out of
doors. Perhaps to-night he might find her at home.
At all events, the walk would lighten his loneliness.</p>

<p>Painfully donning his highest collar, gayest tie and
new cream-colored crash suit, the Fighter turned his
face toward Pompton Avenue. As he neared the
Standish house, the murmur of voices, occasional
bursts of low laughter and the idle twanging of a
guitar reached his ears. Several people were grouped
on the piazza. So interested were they in a story one
of their number was telling that Caleb stood on the
topmost step before his approach was noticed.</p>

<p>Letty, following eagerly each tone of the narrator&#8217;s
voice, in search of the psychological moment for
laughing, looked up to see Conover towering over
her, bulking huge against the dying dusk. Her involuntary
little cry brought the story to a premature close.</p>

<p>It was Caine, who, sitting back among the shadows,
rose as usual to the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, old chap!&#8221; he said, cordially, as he came
forward, &#8220;You loomed up before us like a six-by-four
ghost. Letty,&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Standish had recovered herself sufficiently to
welcome the late arrival with a deprecatory effort at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
cordiality and to introduce him to three or four young
people of the neighborhood who dropped in for an informal
summer&#8217;s evening chat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to see you again, Miss Standish!&#8221; exclaimed
Caleb, heartily, after nodding acknowledgement to the
somewhat cold recognition of the other callers. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been around two or three times. But you&#8217;re always
out when I call. My bad luck. But I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to keep
on callin&#8217; just the same. It&#8217;s lonesome in town this
summer. Lonesomer, seems to me, than it ever was
before. So I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to stroll &#8217;round here kind of
often if you&#8217;ll let me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had taken the place on the steps momentarily
vacated by a youth who had been sitting by Letty and
who had risen when the girl introduced Conover.
Letty, while she tried to murmur something gracious
in reply to his remark, found herself looking at his
shadowy form in abject terror. Even through the
gloaming his light, alert eyes seemed to seize and hold
her will. The hands she clasped nervously in her lap
grew cold and damp. Her nose quivered a distress
warning that the cruel darkness rendered of no avail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Been up to the Arareek lately?&#8221; he went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Yes&mdash;I&mdash;not <i>very</i> lately,&#8221; she stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither&#8217;ve I,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Too hot for the
walk. When it gets cooler I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to try and get
there ev&#8217;ry week. I ought to go out more. I&#8217;m
beginning to see that. My s&#8217;ciety manners are gettin&#8217;
rusty. Fact is, I&#8217;ve had to hustle so hard all my life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
I&#8217;ve never took time to have any fun. But things are
shapin&#8217; themselves now like I was goin&#8217; to have a
chance to look around me at last. Then I hope I&#8217;ll
see more of <i>you</i>, Miss Standish,&mdash;a good deal more,&#8221;
he continued, lowering his voice to a rumble that excluded
the rest from the <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I shall be very glad,&#8221; faltered the poor girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;So&#8217;ll I,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;I&#8217;m not such a stoopid,
nose-to-the-grindstone feller as you may think, Miss
Standish. I&#8217;ve been busy; that&#8217;s all. Now that the
cash is runnin&#8217; in, I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to enjoy it; an&#8217; try to do
more in s&#8217;ciety than I&#8217;ve been able to, so far. A single
man don&#8217;t get much show to rise in the social back
yard; not without he has tricks. An&#8217; I haven&#8217;t any,&mdash;thank
the Lord! But even if I can&#8217;t get a lot of
popularity for myself, why&mdash;maybe I can annex some
of it in my wife&#8217;s name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your wife?&#8221; she interposed, a hope breaking
through the pall of misery that was settling over her,
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you were&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Married? I ain&#8217;t. But I hope to be before
I&#8217;m so very much older. Ev&#8217;ry man ought to
marry. &#8217;Specially a man with my money an&#8217; p&#8217;sition.
I&#8217;m able to support a wife, better&#8217;n any other
feller you know. Don&#8217;t you think I&#8217;d ought to get
one?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s dry tongue refused its office. Conover
went on in the same loathed undertone of confidence:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve &#8217;bout made up my mind on that point, Miss
Standish. An&#8217; when I an&#8217; the young lady I have in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
mind gets to be a little better acquainted, I hope she&#8217;ll
agree with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; gasped Letty, for once fighting back
the tears, &#8220;suppose the girl you picked out happened
to be in love with someone else? Or even,&#8221; gasping
again, at her own boldness, &#8220;even engaged to someone
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;d worry me so very much,&#8221; he
said slowly, bending nearer to his shrinking hostess,
&#8220;I&#8217;m in the habit of takin&#8217; what I want. An&#8217; I never
yet found anyone who could keep me from doin&#8217; it.
That sounds like a brag. But it ain&#8217;t; as I hope I&#8217;ll
be able to show you some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl rose, shaking, to her feet. The advent of
a new guest alone saved her from fleeing panic-stricken
to her room. But as a step sounded on the
walk below, she paused irresolute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening!&#8221; said the late comer, limping
slightly as he mounted the steps.</p>

<p>At his voice a murmur of surprise rippled from the
others. Letty went forward to welcome him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Blacarda!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
even know you were out of the hospital. I&#8217;m so glad
to see you again. You came to talk to Father, of
course. I can&#8217;t venture to hope we young people drew
you here. I&#8217;ll have him sent for,&#8221; touching the doorbell,
&#8220;He&#8217;s in his study.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a servant departed in search of Reuben Standish,
she went on; striving by words to drown her dull
terror:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>&#8220;You know everyone here, I think. Except perhaps&mdash;have
you ever met Mr. Conover?&#8221;</p>

<p>Blacarda halted midway in a step forward, and
stood uncertain, gaping. Caleb, however, was charmingly
at his ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Blacarda!&#8221; he said effusively, &#8220;Hear
you&#8217;ve been laid up. Too bad! What was it that
knocked you out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing that deserves mention from any honest
man,&#8221; retorted Blacarda, his voice trembling with rage
and an irresistible fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;As bad as that?&#8221; cried Conover, with pleasant
badinage, &#8220;Be careful to keep out of its way in the
future, then, son. These things that don&#8217;t &#8216;deserve
mention&#8217; are sometimes apt to be dangerous. &#8217;Specially
when you get a second attack of &#8217;em. Hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>The words, blatantly meaningless to all save Caine
and the man Caleb addressed, deprived Blacarda of
speech. The injured guest had an insane impulse to
run away. The coarse joviality of his conqueror
seemed more fraught with menace than an open threat
would have been. The situation was saved by the arrival
of Reuben Standish. The banker after a word
of recognition to Blacarda, greeted Caleb with a
warmth that sent ice to Letty&#8217;s heart. Not knowing
that her father, like Caine, was also gleaning in the
Conover field (and with a profit that bade fair to rehabilitate
the crumbling Standish fortune), the girl
read in his cordiality only the news that another had
fallen under the master sway of the Fighter&#8217;s will.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>In the confusion of several guests&#8217; simultaneous departure
Letty found a chance to slip away to her own
room. Nor did she reappear until the sound of a
loud &#8220;Goodnight!&#8221; and the crunch of heavy feet upon
the walk told her that Conover had at last gone. On
the veranda she found Caine waiting in hope of another
glimpse of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the matter?&#8221; he asked, solicitously,
&#8220;Why did you run away from us all? Conover
waited a long time, hoping you&#8217;d come back. At last
I told him you had a sick headache. Then&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It happened to be true,&#8221; she answered brokenly.
&#8220;Oh, Amzi, I&#8217;m so <i>miserable</i>! <i>Why</i> did that man
come here? I&#8217;ve left word I&#8217;m never at home to
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be nice to him for my sake, won&#8217;t you, darling?&#8221;
pleaded Caine, &#8220;I can&#8217;t explain. But I&mdash;need him
very much just now. I can&#8217;t afford, for business reasons,
to have him offended.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if you only knew&mdash;!&#8221; she cried; then
stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Knew what? Tell me,&#8221; he begged, &#8220;Is anything
troubling you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The formless fear she sought to voice died on her
lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Nothing at all. But I&#8217;m very
tired. Goodnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with this lachrymose evasion he was forced to
content himself. But before going to bed, Letty, as
a last hope, sought out her father.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; she entreated, nerving herself to the
effort, &#8220;I <i>wish</i> you would forbid Mr. Conover the
house. I&mdash;I hate him. I&#8217;m <i>afraid</i> of him. Oh,
Father, <i>please</i> don&#8217;t let him come here any more!&#8221;</p>

<p>Standish looked up from his evening paper with a
frown of cold displeasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do wish, Letty,&#8221; he said with the dry little cough
that nowadays accompanied his every sentence, &#8220;that
you would learn self control. You are not a baby
any longer. These childish prejudices of yours are
absurd. Mr. Conover is&mdash;very useful to me&mdash;and
to the bank,&mdash;just at present. Out of deference to
me, you will please treat him with courtesy whenever
he chances to call!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Letty, weeping uncontrollably, had run from
the room. She felt herself helplessly enmeshed in a
net whose cords her best-loved were drawing tighter
and tighter about her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


<small>CALEB CONOVER GIVES A READING LESSON</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Conover, during the month that followed, found
time from his financial warfare to make three more
calls at the Standish house. The soft-hearted Divinity
of children and fools was merciful to Letty on
those occasions, inasmuch as there were each time
other guests on the dusky piazza. The girl thus
avoided intimate talk of any long duration with her
giant visitor. Yet she noted with helpless dread that
at every successive visit the Fighter&#8217;s manner told
more and more of a subtle understanding between
them; of an increasing sense of possession. Wildly,
impotently Letty resented this. But she watched its
growth with a dazed fascination.</p>

<p>By turns she clung to Caine in a mad craving for
protection; or repulsed him with pettish impatience as
a defense which she instinctively felt would not be
strong enough to guard her when her hour of stark
need should come.</p>

<p>More than once it occurred to Letty to tell Caine all
her fears. But, stripped of woman&#8217;s formless, illogical
intuition, what was there to tell? She had no
shadow of actual fact to go on; and men demand
facts. So she continued to puzzle her lover by alternate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
spells of effusive demonstration and chilling sulks.</p>

<p>The ever-ready tears, too, began to leave marks.
She was not looking her best. In her lonely misery
the girl was glad of this. She wished Conover would
call by daylight instead of at night, so that he might
see and be repelled by what she was pleased to term
the &#8220;ravages&#8221; his attentions were wreaking on her
once placid face. Caine and her father, it is true, gave
most flattering heed to these &#8220;ravages&#8221;; but heartlessly
ascribed them to hot weather and need of change
to the country.</p>

<p>Mrs. Standish&#8217;s vitreous gaze, too, mingled a
mild curiosity with its irritating benevolence. Once
she asked Letty quite tactfully if the engagement with
Caine were not perhaps a mistake and if the girl might
not be in danger of blighting her God-given young
life by a loveless marriage. To which random shot
Letty paid the passing tribute of a flood of tears that
convinced Mrs. Standish of her own spiritual inspiration
in putting the question. The net result of it all
was that Letty and her aunt were packed off, with
Clive, to the seaside for a month.</p>

<p>Miss Standish&#8217;s departure did not greatly trouble
Caleb. He himself was nearing the beginning of his
much heralded &#8220;first vacation.&#8221; Indeed, Caine, coming
disconsolately to the Fighter&#8217;s room, one evening,
just after seeing Letty&#8217;s train off, found Conover sitting
on the floor beside an open trunk. A mass of
clothing, also on the floor, radiated away from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
trunk on every side. Perspiring, red of face, Caleb
was reaching out methodically for garments, folding
them with slow care of the self-made man and stowing
them away in fast-rising layers in the leathern
maw that gaped so hungrily for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just come from seeing Miss Standish and her
aunt off to Block Island,&#8221; announced Caine, routing a
pile of clothes from a chair and seating himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Block Island, hey?&#8221; said Caleb, &#8220;Anything like
Coney?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; laughed Caine, &#8220;nor like any other place on
earth. A treeless plateau above the ocean. Ugly at
first glance, but with a hundred-year-old charm that
somehow grips one. Sea, sunshine and wind; and the
eternal roar of the surf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; grunted Caleb, disapprovingly, &#8220;Nice,
lively sort of a joint for a busy man to go lookin&#8217; for
fun! &#8217;Bout as jolly as its own jail, I should think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has no jail,&#8221; retorted Caine, &#8220;No jail, no
almshouse, no asylum. There hasn&#8217;t been a criminal,
nor a pauper, nor an insane person on the whole island
in a century. There is only one policeman&mdash;or was
when I used to go there. And he used to take turns
serving as driver of one of the Island&#8217;s two horse-cars.
There&#8217;s a historic yoke of oxen, too, that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a jail&mdash;or a crime&mdash;or an institootion of
any sort?&#8221; cried Conover. &#8220;Son, you&#8217;re stringin&#8217;
me! What do the local pol&#8217;ticians do for a livin&#8217;,
then? If Noo York&#8217;s a paradise for grafters, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
Block Island of yours must be a hell for &#8217;em. Ain&#8217;t
anyone ever waked up there to the chances that&#8217;s
layin&#8217; around waitin&#8217; to be took?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk that way when you see the Standishes
again,&#8221; counseled Caine, &#8220;Mrs. Standish looks on
Block Island as part of her religion. She&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; grinned Caleb. &#8220;I s&#8217;pose so. I can see the
old lady doin&#8217; saint-poses on the sand there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All her attitudes are beatitudes,&#8221; agreed Caine.
But as far as concerned Conover&#8217;s comprehension, he
might as well have said it in Greek.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; went on Amzi, &#8220;I have some fairly
sure information from our political reporter that
ought to interest both of us. It&#8217;s about Blacarda.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you mean Blacarda&#8217;s got next to the Gov&#8217;nor
and arranged a special session of Legislature in September,&#8221;
interposed Caleb, &#8220;I knew that a week ago.
The Starke bill&#8217;s to be flashed on &#8217;em in a new form,
without our gettin&#8217; wind of it, an&#8217; it&#8217;s to be rushed
through, with an idea of knockin&#8217; our Steeloid combine
flatter&#8217;n a pancake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew all this a week ago? Why didn&#8217;t
you&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my business to know things,&#8221; replied Conover,
&#8220;If I didn&#8217;t, I&#8217;d be takin&#8217; orders still, instead
of givin&#8217; &#8217;em. As for not tellin&#8217; <i>you</i>, what was the
use? You&#8217;d a&#8217; found it out soon enough; an&#8217; I&#8217;ve
been too busy to run an inf&#8217;mation bureau. I&#8217;ll be
ready for Friend Blacarda an&#8217; his crowd when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
time comes; same&#8217;s I was before. Just because I
don&#8217;t hire a brass band to p&#8217;rade the streets carryin&#8217; a
placard of my plans, you mustn&#8217;t run away with the
idee that I&#8217;m overlookin&#8217; any bets. I&#8217;ve got everything
in line. We&#8217;ll win out, same as we did last
Spring; an&#8217; by a bigger margin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you may be detained as you were before.
And next time you may not get back soon enough.
Blacarda will move heaven and earth to keep you away.
He knows by now,&mdash;as we all do,&mdash;that you weren&#8217;t
boasting when you said your presence in the lobby
meant all the difference between defeat and victory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Caleb, gently flattered, &#8220;But
I&#8217;ll be on deck. It&#8217;s a way I&#8217;ve got. There&#8217;s always
a bunch of weak-spined chaps in our crowd in the
Assembly that&#8217;s so scared at reform threats an&#8217; all
such rot that they&#8217;re ready to stampede if I&#8217;m not on
hand to hammer the fear of the Lord into &#8217;em. An&#8217;
that same crowd&#8217;s still big enough to turn the vote
if they bolt to cover. But they won&#8217;t. I&#8217;ll be
there. Blacarda ain&#8217;t likely to play the same game
twice. Apart from its bein&#8217; useless, he&#8217;s too scared.
An&#8217; there&#8217;s not another trick in all the pack that can
get past my handy little bunch of secret service men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if the bill <i>should</i> pass&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to. How often have I got to ding
that into your head? It ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I&#8217;m over-anxious,&#8221; Caine defended himself,
&#8220;But you must remember, practically all my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
money is in Steeloid. On your recommendation I
have put every available dollar in it. So have Standish
and a half dozen others I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then lay back an&#8217; be happy,&#8221; advised Conover,
&#8220;After that bill is smashed an&#8217; the public sees Steeloid
is on the ground to stay, the stock&#8217;ll take another big
hop. If you an&#8217; Standish an&#8217; the others have a few
thousands to use in buyin&#8217; on margin you&#8217;ll clean up
a good lookin&#8217; pile. I&#8217;ve got other deals on now that
make Steeloid look like thirty cents. So I ain&#8217;t lyin&#8217;
awake worryin&#8217; on my own account. It&#8217;s as much for
you fellers as for myself that I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to get down to
work on the Blacarda matter, as soon as I come back
from my vacation. It&#8217;ll mean a week or two of big
work, on the quiet. Then the bill&#8217;s comin&#8217; up an&#8217;&mdash;goin&#8217;
down for keeps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re awfully good to give us these tips,&#8221; said
Caine &#8220;And we all appreciate it. But aren&#8217;t you
afraid Blacarda may attack some other interests of
yours as well as Steeloid? He hates you; and he is
not the sort of a man to confine himself to a single line
of revenge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s where you&#8217;re wrong, son,&#8221; answered Conover,
&#8220;The trouble with you people is, you get all
your learnin&#8217; from books wrote by other folks as
stoopid as yourselves. The thing to study ain&#8217;t a
book. It&#8217;s your feller-man. Then there&#8217;d be fewer
folks took in by gold-brick games. Look at me, now,
f&#8217;r instance. I never read a book clear through in my
life. But there ain&#8217;t a man of my &#8217;quaintance I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
haven&#8217;t read through. So, they&#8217;re as easy for me to
read as a primer. Now, <i>you</i> look at Blacarda as a
sort of man who&#8217;s li&#8217;ble to attack me from a dozen
sides at once. That&#8217;s &#8217;cause you can&#8217;t read him. I
can. An&#8217; I know what he&#8217;s li&#8217;ble to do an&#8217; what he
ain&#8217;t. Blacarda b&#8217;longs to the King Cobra class.
Harmless as a kitten to them that knows where his
poison&#8217;s hid, an&#8217; only dang&#8217;rous to folks that picks
him up by the wrong end.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caleb, warming to his theme, leaned back against
the corner of the table and laid down the coat he was
folding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Men who read men,&#8221; said he, oracularly, &#8220;rule
men. Men who read books are ruled by the folks
who wrote them. That&#8217;s the diff&#8217;rence. Let me explain
what I mean by what I said &#8217;bout cobras. I had
to run down to Noo York last fall on business. I had
a couple of hours on my hands an&#8217; I went up for a
look at the Bronx Zoo, there. I went into a squat,
Dago-lookin&#8217; joint called the &#8216;Rept&#8217;l House.&#8217; Full
of snakes and crawly, slimy things. Big crowd in
front of one glass cage. Only snake in that cage was
a big, long, brown critter with an eye that wa&#8217;nt good
to look at. The sign said he was a King Cobra an&#8217;
habitated somewhere or other. The attendant wanted
to wash the winders of that cage from the inside.
What does he do? Does he put his arms in an&#8217; wiggle
a mop within reach of Mister King Cobra? Not
him. He, or his boss, I guess, had learned to read
snakes like I read men. What does he do? He slaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
open a little door in the back of the cage, slings in a
two-foot black snake an&#8217; slams shut the door, quicker&#8217;n
scat, before the Cobra knows what&#8217;s up. There lays
the little black snake wrigglin&#8217;, scared like, on the
floor of the cage among a lot of little red lizards that&#8217;s
runnin&#8217; &#8217;round in the sand.</p>

<p>&#8220;The King Cobra lifts up till his head&#8217;s about six
foot above ground, an&#8217; he looks down at the wrigglin&#8217;
black snake, like he was sizin&#8217; up whether the little
feller has any fight in him or not. An&#8217; say! It was
&#8217;nough to give a feller the creeps to see that cobra-snake&#8217;s
eye as he watched &#8217;tother. Then, he seems
to make up his mind the black snake ain&#8217;t bent on
c&#8217;mittin&#8217; sooside by beginnin&#8217; the fight. So down
swoops the King Cobra with a sort of rustly, swishin&#8217;
rush; an&#8217; he grabs the little snake around the middle.
No&mdash;not by the head or tail. He&#8217;s more mad than
hungry. So he grabs him by the middle. An&#8217; he
hangs on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now what does the attendant do? He opens the
door at the back, kneels on the threshold, leanin&#8217; out
right above the King Cobra, an&#8217; ca&#8217;mly begins washin&#8217;
the winders with his long mop. Ev&#8217;ry swipe that man
makes at the glass, his hand comes within a foot of
the Cobra. But he didn&#8217;t even look at the big, pizenous
brute coiled up there below his hand. He goes
on washin&#8217; the winder like there wasn&#8217;t a snake within
ten miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; asked Caine, interested in spite of himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
&#8220;there was surely danger that the Cobra might drop
the little snake and strike at the man? If&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just the point!&#8221; cried Caleb, &#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t.
His pizen an&#8217; his temper was otherwise engaged.
He&#8217;d sunk his fangs into one en&#8217;my. An&#8217; it ain&#8217;t
cobra natur&#8217; to let go, once he&#8217;s got his grip. I found
that out by askin&#8217; one of the keepers. The man with
the mop was as safe in that cage, just then, as he&#8217;d a&#8217;
been in a Meth&#8217;dist Conf&#8217;rence. The Cobra had just
one idee. An&#8217; that idee was already on the job.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, maybe you&#8217;re wonderin&#8217; what this long yarn
has to do with Blacarda. It has ev&#8217;rything to do with
him. He&#8217;s the King Cobra sort, if ever any man was.
An&#8217; in his case, I&#8217;m the man with the mop. Blacarda&#8217;s
fitted out with a whole lot of fancy venom.
An&#8217; he&#8217;d like nothin&#8217; better&#8217;n to get his fangs in me.
I can&#8217;t say I exac&#8217;ly blame him. But I ain&#8217;t hankerin&#8217;
to get bit. So I throws into his cage a little snake
called &#8216;Steeloid&#8217;. An he nabs it. So long&#8217;s he&#8217;s
got his teeth in that, he ain&#8217;t got the bigness of mind
to bite anything else. When Steeloid&#8217;s over, I&#8217;ll toss
him another little snake, an&#8217; so on to the end of the
chapter. He&#8217;ll keep gnawin&#8217; away, with the idee he&#8217;s
hurtin&#8217; me terr&#8217;ble. An&#8217; I&#8217;ll go &#8217;bout my winder-washin&#8217;
bus&#8217;ness meanwhile; knowin&#8217; he&#8217;s too much
took up with his little snake to do me any hurt. Why,
son, &#8217;twas one of <i>my</i> men that put Blacarda up to
this scheme of gettin&#8217; a Special Session called so he
could knock my Steeloid Comp&#8217;ny out.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>Caine made no reply; but watched Caleb mop the
perspiration of unwonted verbosity from his forehead.
At last he asked, with his bantering smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you read <i>me</i>, by any chance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I read my A. B. C.?&#8221; retorted Caleb in fine
contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not buyin&#8217; a red can&#8217;py an&#8217; givin&#8217; two-dollar
character readin&#8217;s,&#8221; said Conover brusquely, &#8220;Ever
in the Adirondacks? Anything to do there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty&mdash;for the man who can appreciate its
glories,&#8221; retorted Caine with pleasant insolence, &#8220;Very
little for a man of your type, I should fancy. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hoped maybe you could put me on to some of the
pointers,&#8221; answered Caleb. &#8220;It&#8217;s the first vacation
I ever had. An&#8217; I want all the fun out of it I can get.
But I&#8217;m blest if I know where the fun comes in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A ward-heeler would probably regard a Corot in
much the same way,&#8221; observed Caine, still inwardly
smarting at the Fighter&#8217;s good natured contempt,
&#8220;But surely Miss Shevlin must have told you in some
of her letters the sort of life they lead there&mdash;something
of her amusements? You can probably get a
better idea of it all from her letters than from anything
I could tell you. Doesn&#8217;t she&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ev&#8217;ry letter she writes is full of it,&#8221; acquiesced
Caleb, gloomily, &#8220;But I can&#8217;t make out what the
good times are. Just listen to this, f&#8217;r instance.
First letter I had from her. No. The second.&#8221;</p>

<p>From a drawer he drew a small metal case, unlocked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
and opened it. It was full of letters. Each
envelope that met Caine&#8217;s inquisitive eye bore Desir&eacute;e
Shevlin&#8217;s handwriting. Selecting one from the budget,
Caleb opened it with a strangely gentle motion
of his stubby fingers, glanced in silence over a few
lines, then read aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s like some wonderful dream; and every day
I&#8217;m afraid I shall wake up and find it isn&#8217;t so. The air
is like crystal that has been dipped in balsam.&#8217; Why
in blazes,&#8221; interpolated Conover, in perplexity,
&#8220;should anybody want to dip crystal in balsam. I
can&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; adjured Caine, &#8220;I understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I feel as if I were on the top of the world,&#8217;&#8221; pursued
the letter, &#8220;&#8216;The sky is so big, so near. And it
seems to rest on the crests of these splendid old
mountains. The Antlers is on a side hill, partly
cleared of forest and running down to Raquette Lake.
The hotel is white and it&#8217;s on the top of the slope.
It&#8217;s a nice hotel, they say. I&#8217;ve only been in it twice.
Almost nobody is ever indoors except at night or when
it rains. And most of the people don&#8217;t live at the hotel
itself. They live in the cottages and lodges and tents;
and eat in the two big dining rooms that are houses
by themselves. It&#8217;s the outdoorest place I ever saw.
We row and fish and tramp and swim and loaf all day,
and go on picnics. And late in the afternoons there&#8217;s
a regular fleet of boats that put out into the lake to
watch the sunset. &#8220;The Sunset Fleet,&#8221; I call them.
And in the evenings we go to the open camps and lie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
back among the balsam boughs and watch the big camp
fires and tell stories and sing college songs. And sometimes
we coax Ed Bennett to come down to the camp
with his violin and give us &#8220;<i>The Arkansaw Traveler</i>&#8221;
or tell us one of his stories. He has the vocabulary
of a college professor. He knows all the Adirondack
books, and he reads us chapters from them.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And by ten o&#8217;clock, generally, everybody is in bed,
sleeping as no one can sleep in town. One man in a
tent left his mouth open when he went to sleep the other
night, and made funny V-shaped noises that got all
three of the dogs to barking and waked everybody up.
There&#8217;s the <i>loveliest</i> collie here. His name is Rex.
He has adopted me and goes everywhere with me.
Sometimes even when I haven&#8217;t any candy to give him.
I wanted to buy him and take him home. But Mr.
Bennett,&mdash;not Ed, but his brother, the proprietor,&mdash;won&#8217;t
sell him for any price. Isn&#8217;t it horrid? Rex
and Siegfried-Mickey would get on beautifully together,
I know. And their color schemes harmonize
so perfectly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And&mdash;Oh, I forgot!&mdash;there&#8217;s a yellow kitten
here, too, that&#8217;s made friends with me. And what
do you suppose one of the boys did the other evening?
We had a welsh-rarebit party at the open camp, and
he poured beer all over the yellow kitten&#8217;s fur, just
before we went away. And of course, cat-like, she
licked it all off. And she came bounding into my
room ten minutes later in a perfectly <i>scandalous</i> condition.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
The beer she had licked up from her fur had
gone to the poor little thing&#8217;s head. Her eyes were
as big as saucers and she purred all the time like a
wagon-ful of rattly steel rails. And she went dancing
&#8217;round in circles on three legs and trying to climb
the wall; till she fell asleep in my waste basket.
Wasn&#8217;t it a shame? I&#8217;m sorry I laughed. But she <i>did</i>
look so weird. And her fur smelt so horribly of beer
that I <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> pick her up and try to reason with her.
Next day she was the living picture of remorse. I
got her some ice to lap and put a blue ribbon on her.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I know you&#8217;ll love the Adirondacks. Just think!
In six weeks and two days you&#8217;ll be here. By the
way, you must remember not to speak of coming &#8220;up&#8221;
to the Adirondacks, or going down from them. Nobody
does. They all speak of coming &#8220;in&#8221; and going
&#8220;out&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know why. Neither does anyone I
ask. Perhaps that&#8217;s the reason. I&#8217;m saving all the
beautifullest places to show you. The prettiest rows,
the wildest trails. Perhaps we can see a deer.
Wouldn&#8217;t it be fun? I do so want to see one before I
go. And we&#8217;ll climb Blue Mountain and make the
trip through the chain of lakes, too. Can&#8217;t you come
earlier than you planned? I hate to think you&#8217;re
missing all this glorious time.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; a lot of the same sort,&#8221; added Caleb, folding
and putting away the letter with unconscious tenderness,
&#8220;Writes dandy letters, don&#8217;t she? But it don&#8217;t
make sense to me. So far&#8217;s I can see, there&#8217;s nothin&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
to do but get cats drunk and watch camp fires an&#8217;
get all het up by rowin&#8217; an&#8217; climbin&#8217; hills. Where&#8217;s
the fun in all that for a grown man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Shevlin will be there,&#8221; suggested Caine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Course she will,&#8221; said Caleb, &#8220;Otherwise, d&#8217;you
s&#8217;pose I&#8217;d waste my time goin&#8217;? I wonder how I was
ever jollied into promisin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Conover,&#8221; remarked Caine, rising to leave,
&#8220;You may have spent a long time learning to read
men; but what you don&#8217;t know about women&mdash;and
about yourself, for that matter&mdash;would fill a Carnegie
Library. Goodnight.&#8221;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />


<small>ON THE TOP OF THE WORLD</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Conover woke from a quaint dream of being buried
alive in an ill-fitting coffin. And dawning consciousness
proved the dream to have been but a mild exaggeration.
For he was ensconced in a sleeping car
berth. Gray light was peeping through the lowered
shade. Much-breathed air, mingled with black dust
pressed down upon the Fighter&#8217;s lungs. From a
nearby section came the fretful whine of a baby. The
stiff berth-curtains swished awkwardly inward and
out, to the swing of the car.</p>

<p>Caleb performed, with ease born of long practise,
that contortionist feat known as &#8220;Dressing in the
berth.&#8221; Then, scrambling out, he lurched down the
narrow, dark aisle toward the washroom at the rear.
The place was already full of half-clad, red-eyed,
touseled men. Some were washing, others painfully
scraping lather from their jaws with safety razors;
still others ransacking bag or suit case for clean linen.
One early bird had completed his toilet and was lounging
in a leather-and-wicker chair, trying to translate
a pink time table; meanwhile industriously filling the
semi-airtight compartment with cigarette smoke.</p>

<p>Conover surveyed his taciturn fellow sufferers;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
glanced over the too-populous room, from the rack-frieze
of neatly triangular folded towels to the ash-and-cuspidor
strewn carpet; then he slouched out into
the relatively fresh air of the aisle. He looked at
his watch. The hour was six-thirty. At seven they
were due at Raquette Lake station. The car was last
of the train. It occurred to Caleb to take his first
glimpse of the Adirondacks. He walked to the rear
door and looked out.</p>

<p>Behind him wound the single track of the little spur
road. On either side it was lined by dark evergreens
that stretched away in an endless vista of monochrome
until the silver mist that hung low over everything
blotted them from vision. The train seemed to be
ploughing its way straight into the untrodden wilderness;
to be the first alien that ever had intruded upon
the vast mystic solitudes of green and gray.</p>

<p>Caleb looked long and without stirring. Then as
the negro porter chanced to come near, the watcher&#8217;s
pent up volume of emotion found vent in one
pregnant sentence:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, you!&#8221; he hailed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a dollar
if you can rustle me a cup of hot coffee!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Out into the clinging mist, onto a long wooden
platform, tumbled the travelers; Caleb in the first
rank. There, drawn up to halt their onset, comic
opera chorus-like, were ranged the vociferating station
clerks of the lake&#8217;s various hotel-camps. A
breath of keen balsam-tinged air bit to Conover&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
very lungs. Instinctively he threw out his chest drinking
in great gulps of strange ozone. From out of
the swirling mist before him rose of a sudden a
slight, girlish figure that ran forward with a glad
little cry and caught both his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re here! You&#8217;re <i>here</i>!&#8221; rejoiced Desir&eacute;e,
careless of bystanders. &#8220;Mrs. Hawarden said
I&#8217;d catch my death if I was on the lake so early. But
I got up at the screech of dawn, and came. Isn&#8217;t it all
wonderful? This mist will burn up in a little while
and then you&#8217;ll <i>see</i>! And do Billy and Aunt Mary
still like farm life? Oh, it&#8217;s so good&mdash;so <i>good</i>&mdash;to
see you! Come. The Antlers launch is around
the other side of the station.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clinging gleefully to one of his big arms, the girl
piloted him through the scurrying groups and the luggage
heaps, to a nearby dock where a half score of
waiting launches panted. From one of the largest
fluttered a dark blue flag with the name &#8220;Antlers&#8221;
picked out on it in white. Into the launch they piled;
Desir&eacute;e still talking in pretty, eager excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the south end of the lake,&#8221; she was explaining.
&#8220;There&#8217;s the store over yonder&mdash;that
farthest red building&mdash;and there&#8217;s the Raquette Lake
House. We had a dance there one night. And out
there&mdash;&#8221; with a wave toward the wall of shining
vapor, &#8220;is where we&#8217;re going. It&#8217;s only a mile.
We&#8217;ll start as soon as the rest can get aboard. Oh, I
<i>wish</i> the mist was gone, so you could see the islands,
and old Blue Mountain keeping guard over&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty damp on the water for you, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;
he interrupted, drawing her mackintosh closer about
her shoulders. &#8220;This fog&#8217;s wet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody ever catches cold, up here on the top of
the world!&#8221; she disclaimed. &#8220;And it <i>isn&#8217;t</i> fog. It&#8217;s
just a little mountain mist. In another half-hour it
will rise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the same,&#8221; he argued, &#8220;I wish you had come
in a carriage, instead of bein&#8217; on the water so early.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A carriage!&#8221; she scoffed merrily. &#8220;<i>Where</i> do
you think you are? These,&#8221; pointing to the docked
rowboats, canoes and launches clustering about them,
&#8220;are the &#8216;carriages&#8217; of the Adirondacks. Why, except
for the white trunk-chariot steed at the Antlers,
there probably isn&#8217;t a horse within three miles of here.
It&#8217;s Venice all over again, in that. Aren&#8217;t you at <i>all</i>
glad to see me?&#8221; she continued, dropping her voice
and noting the man&#8217;s puzzled, unenthusiastic mien.
For an instant, some of the happy light ebbed in the
eyes that had been so brimful of joyous welcome.</p>

<p>Caleb roused himself with an impatient shake at his
own seeming apathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to see you!&#8221; he echoed. &#8220;<i>Glad?</i> Well,
say, you little girl, it&#8217;s the gladdest thing that&#8217;s happened
to me since the day you left Granite. An&#8217; I&#8217;d
be just as glad even if it was in some worse place than
a wet boat all stalled up with mist. Gee! But the
tan makes you look prettier&#8217;n a whole picture album!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Hawarden says my hands are disgracefully
brown,&#8221; said Desir&eacute;e, the happiness running back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
her eyes at his rough praise. &#8220;And my face is as
black as an Arab&#8217;s, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the prettiest between here an&#8217; Granite, all
right,&#8221; he declared stoutly. &#8220;Here, let me pull that
sweater thing higher up around your throat. What
a funny little <i>kid</i> face you&#8217;ve got, anyhow, Dey!&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her with frank delight. The girl&#8217;s
head was bare; the mist clinging like frost crystals to
her shimmering aura of hair. Out of a flushed,
bronzed countenance glowed the wide, child-like eyes
that Caleb had once declared were two sizes too big
for her face&mdash;and in whose depths Caine had more
poetically located &#8220;twin springs of hidden laughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was <i>good</i> to see her. And the man&#8217;s business
cares, his social plans, his matrimonial campaign itself,
faded into nothingness. He was here, by her side.
That was enough. And doubly he realized how poignant
had been the ache of aloneness at his heart, during
every day of her absence. There was a new peace,
an utter content, that enwrapped him now that he was
once more beside her. He did not try to analyze the
emotion. But he knew it mastered him as nothing
else had ever done. He knew it; and, satisfied to look
no farther ahead, he was glad.</p>

<p>The launch had churned clear of the dock and was
beating to northward through the mist barrier. Shadowy
shores slipped past them. To their left, out of the
fog, loomed the boathouse of a camp. Beyond its
float men and girls in shiny bathing suits were splashing
about in the water. Caleb trailed his hand over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
the launch side. At the nip of the icy water he accorded
the swimmers such a glance as he might have
bestowed on the martyrs of old.</p>

<p>A wind danced down from the north, playfully
tearing the lake vapors to silver tatters. A lance of
white sunlight struck through the flying mist-reek.
Out of the obscurity leaped an island; emerald green,
sparkling with diamonds of moisture. Then another,
and another. The mainland&#8217;s vague shores took shape
and beauty. Broad reaches of water flashed azure and
pale gold under the swift caress of wind and sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;See!&#8221; cried Desir&eacute;e. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it perfect?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;It is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But <i>look</i>!&#8221; she commanded. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t once
taken your eyes from my face. How can you
say&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I said goes,&#8221; he answered curtly. &#8220;There&#8217;s
nothin&#8217; to take back.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Conover&#8217;s first day at the Antlers was pleasant; for
he and Desir&eacute;e were together from morning to night.
He was welcomed with effusive cordiality by Jack Hawarden;
with graceful tolerance by the lad&#8217;s mother.
The big tent wherein he was quartered was near
enough to the Hawarden cottage to make the trip to
and fro seem as nothing. More and more strongly as
the day wore on did he feel as though he had reached
some long-sought Mecca. The beauty of the &#8220;top of
the world&#8221; was lost on him; but the beauty of the
girl had in a moment became an integral part of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
every thought. He was dully surprised at himself.
Heretofore he had always taken Desir&eacute;e as much for
granted as he had taken the sunlight itself. To her
he had turned for whatever was happiest and restful
in his life; had done it unthinkingly, as part of his
established routine. But now, after two months of
separation from her, he grasped for the first time all
her presence had meant to him.</p>

<p>The mighty silences of the mountains&mdash;the tumbled
miles of multi-shaded green, strewn with fire-blue
lakes&mdash;all these carried no message to the
hard-headed Fighter, the man of cities. But ever he
caught himself staring at Desir&eacute;e in awed wonder; as
though some veil between them had of a sudden been
snatched away.</p>

<p>That first afternoon he and she went for a long walk
where the twisting red-brown trail wound half aimlessly
through the still forest; and she lectured him
with a sternness that he found delicious, upon his lack
of appreciation for the vistas, nooks and leafy sanctums
she pointed out. Before supper she made him
take her out on the lake, in one of the long, slender
guide-boats, whose over-lapping oar handles he found
so hard to manage. In midstream she bade him stop
rowing, and pointed to the west. Against a green-gold
background of sky, long crimson cloud-streamers
flickered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks as if the wind were on fire,&#8221; she breathed
in ecstasy.</p>

<p>And he, after a perfunctory glance and a word of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
acquiescence, bent again to his oars. The lake was
dotted with boats of the &#8220;sunset fleet.&#8221; The occupants
of a dark blue St. Lawrence skiff hailed them.
Caleb, in obedience to Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s gesture rowed closer.
The oarsman of the other boat proved to be Jack Hawarden
who was returning with his mother from a
climb of the Crags.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this sunset well worth traveling all the way
from Granite to see?&#8221; called Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> kind of pretty,&#8221; assented Caleb.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Pretty!&#8217;&#8221; repeated Mrs. Hawarden in gentle
scorn. &#8220;What a word for such a scene! It brings
out all that is highest and most beautiful in one!&#8221; she
went on soulfully. &#8220;I wish, instead of rowing back to
the Antlers to supper, I might drift on here forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d be li&#8217;ble to get rather hungry after a few
hours of it, I guess,&#8221; volunteered Caleb, feeling he
was somehow beyond his depth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hungry!&#8221; shuddered Mrs. Hawarden, loath to
come down to earth. &#8220;I should be feasting on the
sunset. What more could anyone want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; suggested Conover, dubiously, &#8220;if
you leave it to me, I&#8217;d rather just now have a tripe
sandwich.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Jack,&#8221; said Mrs. Hawarden coldly. &#8220;I
think we&#8217;ll go in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how <i>could</i> you!&#8221; laughed Desir&eacute;e, in mock
despair, as Caleb and she followed. &#8220;Why, her very
<i>boat</i> radiates disgust. She&#8217;ll never forgive you for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
spoiling her rhapsody. A tripe sandwich! How
<i>could</i>&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the first thing that came into my head,&#8221;
he excused. &#8220;An&#8217; this mountain air&#8217;s put an edge on
my ap&#8217;tite that I could shave with. A tripe sandwich
would taste good. I&#8217;m sorry if I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it had been anything less hideously plebeian!&#8221;
she insisted. &#8220;Even roast shoulder of tripe would
have sounded better. Oh, tripe doesn&#8217;t have shoulders,
though, does it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may, for all I know,&#8221; he returned. &#8220;But, say,
Dey, have I made you mort&#8217;fied? Honest, I didn&#8217;t
mean to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>ought</i> to scold you,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;But, for
letting me see that look on poor Mrs. Hawarden&#8217;s
face, I forgive you everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack Hawarden, entering Conover&#8217;s tent a half hour
later, found the Fighter struggling into a dinner
jacket.</p>

<p>&#8220;For heaven&#8217;s sake,&#8221; urged the lad, &#8220;take that
thing off. Except at dances they&#8217;re never worn here.
There&#8217;s a rumor that the boys ran a stranger into the
lake, one summer, for coming to supper in evening
dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First thing that&#8217;s struck me right since I came,&#8221;
grunted Caleb, eagerly beginning to shed the tabooed
garments. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get into something comf&#8217;table in half
a minute if you&#8217;ll wait for me that long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Granite papers keep us posted on your doings,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
said Jack, seating himself on the bed. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
made the old State sit up this summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have it standin&#8217; on its hind legs an&#8217; beggin&#8217;,
before I&#8217;m done,&#8221; chuckled Conover. &#8220;I&#8217;m only just
beginnin&#8217;. How you gettin&#8217; on with Dey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221; asked Jack, uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got her to take your view of the marryin&#8217; problem?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the boy. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad! Been here all summer with her, an&#8217;
had moonlight an&#8217; all that sort of thing to your favor.
I sh&#8217;d think if you was ever goin&#8217; to make her fall in
love with you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; interrupted Jack soberly. &#8220;I counted
on all that, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t get her to see it your way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet. Sometimes I&#8217;m afraid I never shall.
But I shan&#8217;t give up. All my life I shall care for her
and try to make myself worthy of her, whether she
ever gets to caring or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good book-talk,&#8221; commented the Fighter, &#8220;but it
has a kind of a square sound to it, too. Well, good
luck to you! You can&#8217;t say I haven&#8217;t given you all the
chances there was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I appreciate it, sir,&#8221; answered the boy. &#8220;And
soon or late I mean to win. I&mdash;I asked her once
more since we came up here&mdash;It was about a month
ago. But it seemed to make her unhappy. And I
don&#8217;t want to spoil her summer. So I am waiting.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
I&#8217;ll wait for years, if I have to. Some day she may
learn to care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These fellers around here,&mdash;these youngsters
that&#8217;s spendin&#8217; the summer at the <i>ho</i>tel,&#8221; queried Caleb.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t int&#8217;rested in any of them, is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not, sir. She&#8217;s nice to all of them, just as
she is to me. And there isn&#8217;t another girl half so popular.
But I don&#8217;t think she cares. I&#8217;m sure she
doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Conover wondered why Hawarden&#8217;s report gave
him an indefinable sense of relief. He thought the
matter over for a moment; then shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;We&#8217;re keepin&#8217; &#8217;em waitin&#8217;,&#8217;&#8221; he said, slapping his
hair with the heavy military brushes on his table.
&#8220;Come along&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>As he turned to leave, the canvas curtains slowly
parted and a gold-red collie stepped into the tent. He
glanced about him with the air of one quite at home,
and proceeded, with majestic friendliness, to walk
across to where Conover stood.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the measly dog doin&#8217; in here?&#8221; demanded
Caleb, somewhat taken aback at the visit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s Rex,&#8221; answered Jack, as though that
statement explained everything. &#8220;He goes wherever
he wants to. Desir&eacute;e thinks the world of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caleb, mollified, moved nearer to the dog and proceeded
to pat the downy fur of his head.</p>

<p>Rex, without the least appearance of rudeness,
moved quietly away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s like all dogs,&#8221; grumbled Caleb. &#8220;An&#8217;mals
just natch&#8217;lly hate me. I don&#8217;t know why; unless
maybe because I don&#8217;t like &#8217;em. What&#8217;s he got in his
mouth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His ball,&#8221; laughed the boy. &#8220;He always carries
one around. We figured out the other day that he&#8217;s
stolen at least eighty tennis balls this season. He has
them &#8216;planted&#8217; all over the place. One under my bed,
another in the hotel woodbox and so on. Then whenever
he gets lonely he roots one of them out and hunts
up somebody to play ball with him. And we usually
do it. I don&#8217;t know why.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had left the tent and were walking along the
wooden path toward the dining room; Rex trotting
just in front of them, and making them adjust their
pace on the narrow footway to his. At the walk&#8217;s
end, the dog suddenly bolted; and with ears tucked
backward and tail flying, scampered across to where
Desir&eacute;e was just emerging from the Hawarden cottage.
Caleb joined the girl and her chaperone; and
the quartette started once more to the dining room.
Conover and Desir&eacute;e led the way, Rex placidly thrusting
himself between them, as they walked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think he&#8217;s a beauty?&#8221; asked Desir&eacute;e.
&#8220;He&#8217;s&mdash;oh, look!&#8221;</p>

<p>A baby, perhaps two years old, was weaving a tortuous
way, under convoy of her nurse toward the tents.
At sight of Rex, the child deserted her lawful escort
and made a wild, toddling rush for the dog. Six feet
away from him she halted, a gold-and-white fluff of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
irresolute babyhood, scared at her own temerity. Rex
had paused at her approach and stood wagging his
tail, patiently awaiting the next move. The baby,
eyeing him with furtive longing, made the first advance.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>How</i>-do?&#8221; she said, politely, ducking her head in
a propitiatory obeisance at the marvellous gold-red
creature in her path.</p>

<p>As Rex did not reply to the salutation in any language
she could understand, the baby repeated her remark,
a shade more dubiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;You darling little thing!&#8221; cried Desir&eacute;e. &#8220;He&#8217;s
forgotten how to talk or he&#8217;d answer you. You want
to pat him, don&#8217;t you? He won&#8217;t bite. Come along.
See, I&#8217;m holding him for you,&#8221; and she buried a white
hand in the warm fur of the dog&#8217;s neck.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, the child came nearer, with mincing,
uncertain steps, ever ready to turn and flee should
the seemingly quiescent monster show the slightest inclination
to turn and rend her. At length, in a burst
of dashing heroism, she put one pudgy hand on his
head in a gingerly caress. Rex sat down in the path
and with a monumental calm suffered the familiarity.
The baby with a squeal of delight at her immunity,
took his furry head to her breast and squeezed it with
arms that scarce met about the dog&#8217;s soft throat.
Then she ventured on a grandstand play. Looking,
to make sure all saw her, she thrust one small finger
into the dog&#8217;s half-open mouth. Rex laid back his
ears and rolled up his eyes in beatific quiescence.</p>

<p>&#8220;The beauty!&#8221; applauded Desir&eacute;e. &#8220;See, Caleb!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
He&#8217;s trying to look like a Numidean lion. He worships
children. Look at him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget, Desir&eacute;e,&#8221; said Mrs. Hawarden, in icy
pleasantry. &#8220;Rex is not a tripe sandwich. To a rare
soul like Mr. Conover&#8217;s, even a sunset,&mdash;to say nothing
of a mere dog and a child&mdash;must yield to the
charms of supper. Come. We&#8217;re all keeping him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had an idee,&#8221; muttered Caleb, as he passed her
on the way to the dining room, &#8220;that it was &#8217;tother
way round.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />


<small>CALEB &#8220;OVERLOOKS A BET&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The ensuing fortnight was at once the longest and
the shortest fourteen days Conover had ever known.
So far as his companionship with Desir&eacute;e was concerned,
the hours had sped with bewildering haste.
But, otherwise, time had limped on leaden feet. The
message of the hills was not for him.</p>

<p>Green mountains, blue sky and bluer water. And
the smell of balsam that had grown to be dully irritating
to him. His senses instinctively strained for
the roar of traffic, the stark hurry of men, the smell
of cities. Throughout the day the universal stillness
of the wilds was broken only by the occasional &#8220;tck-tck-tck&#8221;
of launches. By night, even this was absent;
and as Desir&eacute;e said, &#8220;God seemed very near.&#8221; But
the hush, the eternal calm of it all wore upon the
Fighter&#8217;s nerves. As well have expected the south
wind to draw whispering melodies from a barrel-organ
as for the spell of the forest to lay its bless&eacute;d and
blessing hand on the brain of this Man of Cities.</p>

<p>At times he caught himself counting the days that
remained, and there was an impatient eagerness in
the count. Then, ever, would come the thought that
each passing day brought him twenty-four hours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
nearer to his parting from Desir&eacute;e. And eagerness
would give way to a sharp, if undefined pain.</p>

<p>Another thing wore on him. To prevent Desir&eacute;e
from guessing at his boredom he was forced to be
always on guard. She had at first been half-afraid he
might not be sufficiently alive to the beauty of it all;
and had exhibited to him her adored woodland treasures
with the wistful pride of a child that shows an
interested stranger its most cherished toys.</p>

<p>To drive the latent wistfulness from her eyes, Conover
had soon entered effusively into the spirit of everything.
And Desir&eacute;e, usually so mercilessly keen to
note his every clumsy effort at deception, was too
happy nowadays to observe his enthusiasm&#8217;s mechanical
tenor. Hence, believing she had made a convert,
she redoubled her efforts in educating him up to the
loveliness of the place. And, with the heroism of a
Regulus, he suffered himself to be educated.</p>

<p>At times of course he struck the wrong note. Once,
for instance, at sunset they paddled through the keel-wide
sandbar channel from Raquette into Eldon Lake
and found themselves in an unrippled basin of black
water set in a circle of forest and &#8220;clearing.&#8221; The
silence hung heavy as velvet. It was the hush of a
newborn, unknown world. The mystic wonder of it
all, beneath the setting sun, caught Desir&eacute;e by the
throat and held her trembling,&mdash;speechless. Caleb,
splashing time with his oar, began to sing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>don&#8217;t</i>!&#8221; she breathed; as though protesting
against sacrilege.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>&#8220;Gee! Was I off the blamed key, again?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she answered, the wonder-light dying
from her face as the spell dissolved. &#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221;
she went on, seeing his chagrin. &#8220;It&#8217;s all right. I&#8217;m
sorry I was cross. You were so busy with the boat
you didn&#8217;t get a chance to notice what a magic lake this
is we&#8217;ve come into; or you couldn&#8217;t have broken the
charm. Look! Can&#8217;t you see Siegfried running
through the hemlocks, on his way to Mime&#8217;s cave?
And that band of dead gray tamaracks down there
with the single flaming maple in the foreground! Isn&#8217;t
it like an army of tree-ghosts with the red standard
in its van?&#8221;</p>

<p>So she prattled on, seeking to keep him from seeing
how he had jarred upon her mood. But he knew,
none the less. And he realized that there were times,
even on vacation, when one must be silent. But what
those times might be he could not guess. Nor did he
dare ask.</p>

<p>When next day they climbed the Crags and looked
down on the gleaming lake with the scattered green of
its islands, she looked at him in eager expectation of
his delight. He surveyed the lake in stony silence.
Then let his gaze run expressionless over the lines of
mountain ramparts far to southward that rose in
ever higher swells until the farthest was half lost in
haze. No word did he speak. He felt he was rising
to the occasion. If one must not speak on Eldon Lake
at sunset it followed that one should be equally reticent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
on the Crags by the brighter light of morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say something!&#8221; she commanded, keenly disappointed
at his apathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noo York must be somewheres in a line with that
biggest mountain over there to the south,&#8221; he hazarded;
glad to learn that the present was, for some
reason, not one of those mysterious speechless occasions.</p>

<p>In the evenings, as a rule, they went to the &#8220;open
camp.&#8221; There in the big three-sided log shed with
its evergreen-lined walls and its deep, blanket-covered
floor of soft balsam boughs, a dozen or
more people were wont to congregate by night.
In front of the shed blazed a Homeric camp fire
that tempered the mountain chilliness and made the
whole place light as day. The young people,&mdash;Desir&eacute;e
and Jack among them,&mdash;usually spent the short
evenings in singing and story-telling. Caleb felt less
at his ease here than anywhere else. For the young
folk talked a language of Youth, that he did not understand.
The stories he found somewhat mild, and
the point of several of them he failed to catch. A
sense of strangeness prevented him from joining in
the songs. He had had no youth; save that which
Desir&eacute;e had imparted to him. And he knew himself
out of place among the carefree, jolly crowd. It made
him feel ponderous, aged, taciturn. The easy laughter
of youth only perplexed him. His sole joy during
these open camp evenings was to lie in a shadowed
corner of the &#8220;lean-to&#8221; and watch the firelight play<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
on Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s bright face; to hear her infectious laugh;
to see how popular she was among the youngsters of
her own age. So long as she did not seek to ease his
boredom by dragging him into the talk, he was well
content to lie thus and drink the delight of her fresh
loveliness. When she made him talk, he straightway
became pompously shy; and managed to convey his
sense of acute discomfort to everyone about him.</p>

<p>Altogether, the Adirondacks, for perhaps the first
time since that wonderland&#8217;s discovery, had found a
visitor who did not speedily become a worshipper.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Receive news!&#8221; announced Desir&eacute;e, one evening
as she met Caleb on her return from a conference
with Mrs. Hawarden. &#8220;To-morrow&#8217;s my birthday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you s&#8217;pose I&#8217;d forgot?&#8221; he asked in reproach,&mdash;&#8220;There&#8217;s
two dates I always manage to remember.
One&#8217;s your birthday. The other&#8217;s the day you&#8217;re
comin&#8217; back to Granite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But <i>that</i> isn&#8217;t the news,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;It&#8217;s
only a running start to get you ready for it. Mrs.
Hawarden&#8217;s going to celebrate by the gorgeousest picnic
you ever heard of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Last one we went on,&#8221; began Caleb, &#8220;I burnt two
of my fingers; an&#8217; there was sand in the lem&#8217;nade.
But,&#8221; he broke off just in time, &#8220;it&#8217;ll be great to go
on another. Where&#8217;s it to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Brown&#8217;s Tract pond. &#8217;Way up at the head of
Brown&#8217;s Tract Inlet. You remember? The inlet
that twists around like a snake that&#8217;s swallowed a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
corkscrew? We&#8217;re going to spend the night. Just
think of that! All four of us. The guide is going
up early in the morning to pitch the two tents and get
everything ready. And we&#8217;re to stramble along at
our leisure and get there about noon. Think! We&#8217;re
actually to camp overnight. I wish there were bears
or catamounts or something, to come not <i>too</i> near
and growl dreadfully. I&#8217;m going to take Rex along
if Mr. Bennett will let me. And&mdash;<i>isn&#8217;t</i> it a nice
way to wind up your vacation? You&#8217;ll have plenty of
time. We&#8217;ll be back here by noon next day, and your
train doesn&#8217;t go till night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not talk about my going away,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d be tickled to death to get back to the
fight. But for the past two days I&#8217;ve been tryin&#8217; to
frame up an excuse to myself that&#8217;d let me stay
longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, why don&#8217;t you? Why <i>don&#8217;t</i> you?&#8221; she cried,
all eagerness. &#8220;I stump you to! <i>Please</i> stay!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, little girl!&#8221; he urged. &#8220;If I could stay
with you an extra hour, d&#8217;you s&#8217;pose I&#8217;d need to be
begged to? It&#8217; a case of <i>must</i>. I got to be on deck
day after to-morrow. That special session of the
Legislature I was tellin&#8217; you about meets week after
next. An&#8217; I&#8217;ve got to work like a dog till then to lick
my crowd into line an&#8217; frame up a stiff enough defence
against your friend, Blacarda. I&#8217;ll be as busy
as a one-armed paper-hanger that&#8217;s got hives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221; she persisted. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been working
away with both hands all your life. You&#8217;re rich.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
What&#8217;s the use of all that money if you can&#8217;t have
some fun?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I get my fun in the winnin&#8217;. Not in the holdin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t even know how to rest. And now,
just as I&#8217;m teaching you, you run away. You could
wait perfectly well, three weeks longer, and then go
back to Granite with us. Just think what a sumptuous
time we&#8217;d have here! I&#8217;m <i>very</i> wise,&#8221; she coaxed.
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you take my advice and stay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d take it in a minute if I could, girl,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! That means you won&#8217;t. Advice is
something everybody asks, everybody gives&mdash;and
nobody takes. I <i>wish</i> you&#8217;d stay. This has been the
beautifullest, happiest two weeks I ever spent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has it, honest, Dey?&#8221; he asked, his heavy face of
a sudden alight. &#8220;Honest? It&#8217;s been &#8217;bout the only
long stretch of happy time I c&#8217;n remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t you stay?&#8221; she demanded.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see?&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a good mind to,&#8221; he said at last.</p>

<p>She clapped her hands, then squeezed his arm as
they swung down the hill together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;I b&#8217;lieve I&#8217;ll do it. It&#8217;d be
fun to see what&#8217;d happen if I was to cut loose from
work for once. An&#8217; you an&#8217; me could be together&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you lose so very much?&#8221; she asked doubtfully,
in belated concern.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>&#8220;No more&#8217;n I could afford. Nowhere near so
much as it&#8217;s worth to have that extry time with you.
My own Steeloid holdin&#8217;s are pretty well covered. It
won&#8217;t be <i>me</i> that goes broke. I own my stock outright;
an&#8217; before the winter&#8217;s over I&#8217;ll get the bill declared
unconstitootional. That&#8217;ll bring the price up
again. I c&#8217;n afford to let up on Blacarda for once.
I&#8217;m dead sure to get him later on the same game, as
well as on somethin&#8217; else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say it won&#8217;t be <i>you</i> who go broke,&#8221; she interposed.
&#8220;Will anyone? I mean if you don&#8217;t go
back day after to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; grinned Caleb, &#8220;If Blacarda&#8217;s bill passes,
our Steeloid stock&#8217;ll will take a big tumble, of course.
For those that owns it outright that&#8217;ll be no great loss;
&#8217;cause it&#8217;ll rocket again as soon as I sick one of my
judges onto the bill&#8217;s constitootionality. But the fellers
I&#8217;ve tipped off to buy on margin&mdash;d&#8217;you understand
all this line of talk?&mdash;those fellers are plungin&#8217;
pretty deep, I hear, an&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will they lose much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of &#8217;em are li&#8217;ble to be &#8217;bout wiped out, I
guess. The el&#8217;gant Amzi Nicholas Caine, f&#8217;r instance,
an&#8217; old Reuben Standish. He&#8217;ll go to pot, <i>sure</i>. An&#8217;
Mr.&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean they went into this on your advice, and
if you aren&#8217;t there to stand by them they will be
ruined?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just &#8217;bout that, I guess. Don&#8217;t blame <i>me</i>. They
wasn&#8217;t &#8217;bliged to take my tips an&#8217; I&#8217;m not responsible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
for &#8217;em. Anyhow, they&#8217;ve made enough off me this
year to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must go back,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;I was very
wrong. It just shows what harm a fluff-brained girl
can do by poking her fingers into business she doesn&#8217;t
understand. Why, Caleb&#8221; she added, with a startled
awe: &#8220;If you&#8217;d done as I asked, who knows how
many families might have been made horribly poor?
And it would all have been my fault. You must go
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Dey!&#8221; he protested, &#8220;You&#8217;re all off. It&#8217;s no
affair of mine what that gold-shirt crowd put their
cash on. I don&#8217;t owe anything to &#8217;em. An&#8217; if I can
give you a good time by stayin&#8217;, the whole bunch of &#8217;em
can hire a brass band an&#8217; march to the poorhouse, for
all I care. If you say &#8216;stay&#8217;, I&#8217;ll stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say you mustn&#8217;t,&#8221; she insisted, &#8220;And it was
dear of you to be willing to, for my sake. Anyway,
I&#8217;ll see you again in three weeks. That won&#8217;t be so
very long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No longer&#8217;n three years is gen&#8217;rally&#8221; grumbled
Caleb; and the subject dropped.</p>

<p>They were on their way to the pretty waterside
building that served the quadruple purpose of casino,
store, post-office and boathouse, for the Antlers. The
arrival of the evening mail was one of the day&#8217;s two
great events; the other being the morning mail&#8217;s advent.
The night had a sting to its air; and the mail-time
gathering was held in the lamplit store instead of
on the porch or dock. A tall clerk was busy sorting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
letters and packages to eager groups of sweater-clad
girls and to men in cold-weather outing garb. Conover
and Desir&eacute;e, awaiting their turn, leaned against
the glass cases opposite the post-office counter and
watched the laughing, excited guests.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I can&#8217;t see&#8221; commented Caleb, &#8220;is why
ev&#8217;rybody&#8217;s always in such a sweat about their mail.
What is there in it for anyone? To ev&#8217;ry env&#8217;lope
that&#8217;s got a check in it there&#8217;s three that has bills; an&#8217;
a dozen with adv&#8217;tisements. To ev&#8217;ry letter that&#8217;s
worth readin&#8217; there&#8217;s ten that&#8217;s stoopid or grouchy
or makin&#8217; a hard-luck touch. An&#8217; as for soov&#8217;nir
postals&mdash;the only folks <i>they</i> int&#8217;rest is those that
sends &#8217;em. People come up here to get away from
the world they&#8217;ve been livin&#8217; in. Yet they scramble
for noospapers an&#8217; letters from that same world, like
they was stranded on a desert island.&mdash;Here&#8217;s our
chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd had thinned. Caleb and Desir&eacute;e went
forward to the mail counter. For Conover there
were a sheaf of letters in business envelopes. He
thrust them without a glance into the pocket of his
tweed coat. Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s sole mail consisted of a long
pasteboard box thickly strewn with vari-colored stamps
and bearing the gold-lettered legend of a New York
florist.</p>

<p>In a second her quick fingers had torn away the
wrappings. As the box was lifted, a whiff of warm
fragrance rushed out; filling the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; gasped Desir&eacute;e, burying her face rapturously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
in a crimson nest of American Beauty roses.</p>

<p>Then, her cheeks aglow and her eyes shining, she
lifted her head and faced Conover.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Thank</i> you! Thank you <i>so much</i>!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;It was perfectly darling of you to remember
my birthday so beautifully. And I love
American Beauties so. I might have known you
would think of that. It&#8217;s just like you. Smell them!
What a dear, thoughtful bless&eacute;d old&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She checked herself at sight of Conover&#8217;s blank expression.
If her own face had borrowed the flush of
her armful of roses, Caleb had exacted similar tribute
from a whole wagonload of imaginary peonies.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m&mdash;I&#8217;m sorry, Dey,&#8221; he blurted out at last,
&#8220;But they ain&#8217;t from me. I&mdash;, well, they must be
from somebody who&#8217;s got more sense. I didn&#8217;t think
to get you anything at all. I didn&#8217;t ever know folks
gave reg&#8217;lar presents on birthdays.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly. For the fading of the happy
light from Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s eyes had its usual effect of leaving
him wordless and miserable.</p>

<p>The girl, embarrassed, fell to turning the flowers over
in their long box. She looked a little tired and her
arrangement of the blossoms was perfunctory. A
card was dislodged from among stems and fell to the
floor. Caleb, picking it up, read Jack Hawarden&#8217;s
name.</p>

<p>&#8220;The measly brat!&#8221; raged Conover, to himself. &#8220;He
ain&#8217;t got a dollar to his back; an&#8217; yet he can bring off
a grandstand play like this, an&#8217; make her look like she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
was a kid seein&#8217; her first Christmas Tree! An now
<i>I&#8217;ve</i> made her look like she wanted to cry! Lord!
If I don&#8217;t give her a whole joolry store for Christmas,
I&#8217;m a Chinaman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, dear old boy!&#8221; she whispered, pressing
close to his arm as they turned to mount the hill
on the way to the Hawarden Cottage, &#8220;I&#8217;ll make <i>believe</i>
they&#8217;re from you and that will be every bit as
nice as if they really were. And you&#8217;ve done more
lovely things for me than everybody else put together.
And I won&#8217;t have you looking pathetic. <i>Stop</i> it!
Now, smile! Oh, what a squidgy, weak sort of a
smile! It&#8217;s all right, I tell you. I know you&#8217;d have
given me <i>much</i> lovelier roses than these if you&#8217;d
thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it!&#8221; he growled bitterly, &#8220;I <i>don&#8217;t</i>
think. I never think. I guess you know I&#8217;d let &#8217;em
cut me up into city blocks if it&#8217;d make a hit with you,
Dey. But what good does that do? When it
comes to bein&#8217; on hand with the million dinky little
stunts that women likes, I&#8217;m always a mile away, somewhere,
hoein&#8217; corn. I wouldn&#8217;t blame you if you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; she cried, a break in her clear voice, &#8220;You
shan&#8217;t talk that way. Do you suppose all the presents
in the world would have made me half as happy as
having you here, this two weeks? Would any present
have cost you one tenth the sacrifice of giving up your
work for my sake? And just now you offered to
throw away thousands of dollars and wreck half a
dozen of people&#8217;s fortunes in order to please me by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
staying longer at the Antlers. What more could
<i>anyone</i> do for me than you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he answered simply, &#8220;But some day
I may find out. An&#8217; when I do,&mdash;why, I&#8217;ll do it.
You can gamble on that, you little girl.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />


<small>FOREST MADNESS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was late the next forenoon when the quartette, in
two guide-boats, set out from the Antlers dock for
their twenty-four hour picnic to Brown&#8217;s Tract Pond.</p>

<p>A guide had started an hour earlier with the camping
equipment and pack. Jack and Mrs. Hawarden led
the way; Desir&eacute;e and Caleb being delayed in starting
by the vast pressure and vaster quantities of candy
that must be brought to bear on Rex before the collie
would consent to trust his cautious young life in their
boat. When at last the reluctant dog&#8217;s fears were
overcome and he lay curled in a contented, furry
heap at Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s feet in the stern,&mdash;Caleb bent to his
oars with a swing that sent the frail guide boat over
the mile of intervening lake in time to enter the inlet
a bare length behind the Hawardens. Under the low
wooden bridge they passed. Then began an erratic
progress.</p>

<p>The sluggish stream wriggles through part of the
old government tract once ceded to &#8220;Ossawotamie.&#8221;
John Brown of anti-slavery memory. Formerly,
green tamaracks lined the lowlands to either side of
the inlet&#8217;s banks. The raising of the dams which,
years ago, signed the murder-warrant for so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
thousand splendid trees, have left the tamaracks
here&mdash;as elsewhere along the watercourses,&mdash;a waste
of feathery gray skeletons.</p>

<p>A bite of Autumn was in the air. From bush and
from waterside grasses, the dying summer flashed
its scarlet-and-gold warning of winter&#8217;s dread approach.</p>

<p>The inlet wound southward in a bewildering series
of turns and twists; perhaps a hundred such abrupt
turnings to the mile. There was hardly scope for
three successive oar-strokes between the twists. Fast
rowing was out of the question. A long stroke or two,
for momentum; then the quick backing of an oar and
a plunge of the stern paddle; and, unless the bow
caught in the jutting huckleberry bushes of the bank,
one turn was safely passed and another was at hand.</p>

<p>The gray stone mountains, with their clumps of evergreens
shot with the red and yellow of maple or birch,
rose against the sky on one side of the marsh. On the
other, the deep forest ran down to the fringe of
tamarack ghosts; a rare white birch standing out
here and there, like a sheeted giant, amid the dusk of
the hemlocks. Above blazed the white sun. The long
grasses hummed with insect life. A mink darted to
cover from beneath the bow of the guide boat. In
the black loam of the bank burrowed a sleek gray
water rat. Far to the northeast, a solitary, everlasting
landmark for all the region, crouched old Blue Mountain,
like some benevolent, haze-shrouded mastodon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t remember,&#8221; observed Desir&eacute;e, &#8220;when we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
weren&#8217;t squeezing past one turn and running into
another. And I can&#8217;t imagine any time when we won&#8217;t
still be doing it. It&#8217;s like one of those weird maze-places
at Atlantic City where you go through a door
only to find yourself staring at three others. The man
who went for a walk and met himself coming back
would have found himself facing whole family groups
of selves if he&#8217;d come up this inlet. There&#8217;s where the
Eighth Lake Carry begins. Over there to the left;
where that tumble-down wooden dock is. We aren&#8217;t
anywhere near Brown&#8217;s Tract Pond yet. Just hear
Jack yodel! He&#8217;s as excited over this picnic as a
school boy. He&#8217;s rowing like mad and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess somebody must a been feedin&#8217; him meat,&#8221;
suggested Caleb unkindly; glancing back over his
shoulders at the leading boat whose oarsman&#8217;s enthusiasm
had driven its bow into the mudbank at one
sharp turn. &#8220;Say, he&#8217; awful much in love with you,
Dey. Are you goin&#8217; to end up by marryin&#8217; him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Desir&eacute;e, shortly.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the boats had been dragged over
the last impasse and the pond was reached;&mdash;a circular
blot of water amid the surrounding hills; a high island
rising in its centre.</p>

<p>A halloo from Jack brought an answering call from
the distant guide. Slipping along the shore where the
yellow sand ran out for yards under its shallow covering
of blue water, the two boats came to rest off the
site chosen for the camp. The two tents were already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
pitched, and a fire crackled merrily. The guide was
busy frying eggs and strips of bacon in huge black
pans. Potatoes bubbled in one pot above the fire;
while from another came the aroma of coffee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven may be as beautiful as this grove,&#8221; sighed
Desir&eacute;e in ecstasy, &#8220;but I&#8217;m perfectly sure it will never
smell so deliciously appetizing. I&#8217;m starved. Is that
drinking-water, Steve?&#8221; she asked, pointing to a pail
with a dipper beside it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes ma&#8217;am,&#8221; replied the guide. &#8220;Or it will be
when I&#8217;ve boiled it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m too thirsty to wait for it to boil,&#8221; she objected
picking up the dipper. &#8220;Won&#8217;t somebody else have
some?&mdash;Mrs. Hawarden?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t healthy to drink water from forest springs
till it&#8217;s been boiled,&#8221; put in the guide. &#8220;It&#8217;s likely to
be all chock-full of germs. Boilin&#8217; kills em,&#8221; he added,
proud of his scientific lore.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d as lief be a germ aquarium as a germ cemetery,&#8221;
decided the girl, drinking deep of the cold,
limpid water, &#8220;Is there any fishing in this pond, I
wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; drawled the guide, piqued that his medical
advice should have gone for naught, &#8220;there&#8217;ll be better
fishin&#8217; to-night than there is just now. There&#8217;s pretty
sure to be a heavy mountain fog after a day like this.
And those fogs get so thick, around here, sometimes,
that the fish can&#8217;t tell the difference between the fog
and the water. And they swim right up into the tents.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
I&#8217;ve caught &#8217;em that way dozens of times. Forrest
Bird and &#8216;Smiling&#8217; Kelly was telling me they came
here once and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it <i>that</i> sort of a bait you used?&#8221; asked Desir&eacute;e
innocently, pointing to a flask-neck that had
worked its way into view from the pocket of the
guide&#8217;s jacket as he leaned over the fire.</p>

<p>He shoved back the offending flask; grinning sheepishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because&#8221; went on Desir&eacute;e with the same wide-eyed
innocence, &#8220;I&#8217;ve always heard it attracted more
snakes than fish. Isn&#8217;t it lucky there are no snakes
in the Adirondacks?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rex sniffed longingly at the candy-box lying on the
pile of wraps near the fire. Then he looked at Desir&eacute;e
and waved his tail with an air of disinterested friendliness.
After which he resumed his study of the box.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will make you quite ill if you eat candy before
dinner, Rexie,&#8221; the girl told him.</p>

<p>The dog seemed impressed; for he moved away
from the coveted treasure. But he eyed Desir&eacute;e so
sadly that she relented. Opening the box she searched
till she found a chocolate wafer and tossed it to Rex.
He caught it in mid-air. Caleb absent mindedly
helped himself to a piece of candy from the open box.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a young man so benighted,&#8221; she admonished
Conover,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;He never knew when he was slighted.</div>
<div class="indent">He&#8217;d go to a party</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
<div class="verse">And eat just as hearty</div>
<div class="indent">As if he&#8217;d been really invited.</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;And the moral of this is:&mdash;Wait till people say
&#8216;Please have some&#8217; before you dip in. <i>Where</i> are
your manners, Caleb? <i>Now</i>, what are you looking
at?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, but you&#8217;re pretty, to-day!&#8221; remarked Conover,
his glance roving appraisingly over her trim figure
in its roughing costume, and at the tanned, eager
little face, &#8220;As pretty&#8217;s you can be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose everyone is,&#8221; laughed Desir&eacute;e, in embarrassment;
noting Mrs. Hawarden&#8217;s air of seeming
not to have heard the bald praise, &#8220;Oh, see the beautiful
green caterpillar that&#8217;s come to our party! And
a whole army of nice hungry ants! There&#8217;s a spider,
too. <i>Do</i> drive him off, Jack! Don&#8217;t kill him, though.
It&#8217;s bad luck. For the spider, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Avaunt, dread monster of the wilderness!&#8221; declaimed
Jack; brushing the offender away.</p>

<p>Dinner and a long lazy afternoon. A row of exploration
about the pond&#8217;s edge, a visit to the island;
a ramble through the woods;&mdash;and nightfall found
the campers eating a firelight supper with the crass
hunger of the unaccustomed outdoor sojourner. Then
a short, yawn-punctuated chat around the camp fire,
and the signal for bed.</p>

<p>It is one thing for a man of cities to be delightfully
sleepy after his first long day in the woods. It is
quite a different matter for him to be able to fall asleep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
on a many-projectioned bed of balsam, while a guide
snores raucously on one side of him and a second man
tosses in uneasy, muttering slumber on the other.
After counting up to one hundred, and keeping tabs
on a flock of visionary sheep as they leaped an equally
mythical wall (and hoping in morbid disgust that
some of them would fall and break their imaginary
necks), Conover rose quietly, pulled on such garments
as he had removed, groped about till he found his thick
waterproof coat and stumbled out into the open. He
kicked the fire&#8217;s smouldering logs into a blaze and
looked at his watch. It was barely nine-thirty. He
took out a cigar and prepared to sit down beside the
logs and smoke himself sleepy again.</p>

<p>Then she came.</p>

<p>He was not surprised. Even before he turned his
head or noticed the fall of her light feet on the mold,
he somehow knew she was drawing near. He looked
around to find her close behind him. Her hair was
caught up loosely, and shimmered like a rust-shot
aureole in the waning firelight. She wore the sweater
and walking skirt of the afternoon. But her high
boots had been changed for moccasins.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t sleep,&#8221; she whispered, clasping the hands
he held out to her, &#8220;All the forest and the silences
seemed calling to me. Besides, Mrs. Hawarden sleeps
so,&mdash;so audibly. All at once, I felt you were out
here. So I came. Is it very late?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered in the same key, &#8220;Not much
mor&#8217;n half past nine. Sit down here an&#8217; I&#8217;ll get a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
blanket to wrap &#8217;round you. I ought to send you back,
so&#8217;s you won&#8217;t catch cold. But it&#8217;s&mdash;somehow it&#8217;s
so good to have you right here by me. This time
to-morrow night I&#8217;ll be glad to remember it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get me any wrap,&#8221; she forbade, stretching
out her hands to the blaze he was again stirring into
life, &#8220;I&#8217;m warm enough. And you&#8217;d fall over something
and swear and that would wake somebody.
Then I&#8217;d have to go back to the stuffy tent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rex, curled up asleep on the far side of the fire,
lifted his head; wakened by the sibillant whispering.
Seeing Desir&eacute;e, he began to smite the earth resoundingly
with his wagging tail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; whispered the girl, raising her finger in
warning; as the collie&#8217;s sleepy, golden eyes blinked
more and more friendly greetings and the bushy tail
increased the tempo of its beats. Mistaking her gesture,
Rex rose with lazy grace, stretched himself,
alternately, fore and aft, collie-fashion; and picked
his way daintily across the cleared space to Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s
side. He lay down at her feet, thrusting his cold nose
affectionately into the hollow of her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a gorgeous night!&#8221; murmured Desir&eacute;e looking
up at the black, star-strewn sky, &#8220;And we were
going to waste it in sleep! The woods are calling.
The dryads and fauns want us to come to their enchanted
dell and dance with them. Shall we?&#8221;</p>

<p>Understanding not a tithe of her words the man
nevertheless caught the flickering light of adventure
in her eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m always game for anything you put a name to&#8221;
he made answer, &#8220;I&#8217;m kind of heavy for dancin&#8217;.
But if it&#8217;ll be any sort of pleasure for you, I might
have a try at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; she warned, &#8220;If you speak as loudly as
that you&#8217;ll be sure to wake them. Isn&#8217;t this <i>fun</i>?&#8221;
she went on with a happy little laugh, &#8220;I feel as if we&#8217;d
run away from school and were going to be scolded
terribly hard when we get back. I dare you,&mdash;oh, I
<i>dare</i> you! I <i>double</i>-dare you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To what?&#8221; he demanded, infected by the sudden
rush of mischief to her face and voice, &#8220;I&#8217;ll do anything
you say. Want me to haul out Steve Martin an&#8217;
Jack an&#8217; lick &#8217;em for you, or set fire to the old lady&#8217;s
tent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither,&#8221; she decreed sternly; adding with perverse
wistfulness, &#8220;Though it would be interesting to see
how Mrs. Hawarden&#8217;s airy dignity would sustain her
in a blazing tent. No, no. What I was going to
dare you to do is much less spectacular. Nothing
more exciting than a walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A walk?&#8221; echoed Conover, &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s near ten
o&#8217;clock, an&#8217; cold as charity. Besides, it&#8217;ll be all dark
an&#8217; damp in the thick part of the woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m <i>sure</i> we&#8217;ll run across a ring of fairies,&mdash;or
a satyr, at the very least. Oh, the night is throbbing
with magic! And the forests are calling. Shan&#8217;t we
answer the call?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds to me more like katydids,&#8221; he demurred,
&#8220;But, if you like, we can take a stroll. We&#8217;ll be back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
in half an hour or so, an&#8217; that ought to be early enough,
even for old Mrs. Propriety in there,&#8221; with a nod toward
Mrs. Hawarden&#8217;s tent, &#8220;But you&#8217;ll want some
wrap, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m warm as toast. This sweater&#8217;s so
wudgy and soft; and it&#8217;s as thick as thick can be.
Come along!&#8221;</p>

<p>Laughing excitedly under their breath, after the
manner of school-boys making safe escape to truancy,
the two stole away on tiptoe from the radius of fire
shine. Rex, waking again at their departure, sighed
as devotion dragged him from sleep and warmth; and
trotted along solemnly in the wake of the two truants.</p>

<p>Before them lay a natural vista winding between
ranks of black trees. Starlight filtered through, giving
an uncanny glimmer to the still darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is like breaking into fairyland!&#8221; gasped the girl,
tense and vibrant with the hushed wonder of it all,
&#8220;We are mortals. We have no right in Oberon&#8217;s
domain. But he sees what very <i>very</i> nice, harmless
mortals we are. So he doesn&#8217;t change us to bats or
fireflies. He just lets us trespass all we want to.
And perhaps he&#8217;ll even let us see a real fairy. An
elf, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caleb laughed, in sheer happiness. Of her Oberon
rigmarole he grasped little. But he saw she was in
childishly wild spirits, and the knowledge of her joy
thrilled him. The cold bit deeper as they struck rising
ground and followed the glimmering forest-vista upward.
Both instinctively quickened their pace to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
from shivering. But mere cold could not quench
Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s pleasure in the simple escapade.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are runaway slaves!&#8221; she cried, her mood
shifting from fairyland to a newer fantasy, &#8220;We are
escaping from a fearsome Simon Legree named Conventionality!
Conventionality is a wicked master who
has whipped us and piled chains on us ever since we
were born. And now we&#8217;ve put him to sleep in two
tents and we&#8217;re running away from him. He&#8217;d be
furious if he woke up. But he&#8217;s snoring very industriously.
And he surely won&#8217;t wake,&mdash;in either
tent&mdash;for at least an hour. And by that time we&#8217;ll
be safe back again with our chains all nicely riveted
on. And he&#8217;ll never, never even guess we once ran
away from him. No,&mdash;I&#8217;d rather think we&#8217;re running
away forever and ever and ever,&mdash;and then
some more after that. And he&#8217;ll never find us, no
matter how long he hunts. We&#8217;ll spend the rest of
our life in the enchanted woodland, and live on berries
and nuts. And our faithful hound who&#8217;s followed
us from slavery will catch venison for us. And&mdash;and
if you ask him <i>very</i> politely, Caleb, perhaps
he&#8217;ll catch a tripe sandwich sometimes for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still rememberin&#8217; that awful break of mine?&#8221;
chuckled Caleb, as unreasonably excited as she.
&#8220;That ain&#8217;t fair!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It, <i>wasn&#8217;t</i> a break!&#8221; she pronounced judgment.
&#8220;It was a smashing blow at our Simon Legree, Conventionality.
You are a hero. Not a lowly squidge.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
See how silver the light is getting! I&#8217;m sure that
means we&#8217;re on the courtyard of the fairy palace. I
shouldn&#8217;t be one atom surprised if&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>With a little cry of alarm she clutched Caleb. From
almost under her feet a partridge whirred upward,
his beating wings rattling through the stillness like
double castanets. Rex, with one staccato growl deep
down in his throat, gave chase. But as the bird utterly
refused to fly fair, and even resorted to unsportsmanlike
rocketings that carried it far up through the
treetops, the pursuit was quickly over. Rex, his ruff
a-bristle, strutted back to the girl, walking on the tips
of his toes and casting baleful glances of warning to
left and right at any other lurking partridge that might
be tempted to brave his ire.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it? What <i>was</i> it?&#8221; demanded Desir&eacute;e,
startled far out of her fit of eerie gaiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe &#8217;twas one of those fairies or satires you
was hopin&#8217; would drop in on us,&#8221; suggested Caleb,
cruelly, &#8220;It was a reel treat to see how glad you was
to meet him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re horrid!&#8221; declared the girl. &#8220;As if any
self-respecting fairy would jump up with a noise like
ten gatling guns! I&mdash;Oh, the silver is turning gray.
It&#8217;s fog! The fog Steve Martin said we&#8217;d have to-night.
And it&#8217;s coming down around us like, like a
Niagara of&mdash;of&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of pea soup,&#8221; supplemented Conover. &#8220;It&#8217;s thick
enough to cut. An&#8217; ten minutes ago the sky was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
perfec&#8217;ly clear. Best get back to the camp, before the
measly stuff makes us lose our way. Then we <i>would</i>
be in a sweet fix.&#8221;</p>

<p>Backward they turned upon their tracks. Already
the guiding tree vistas were wiped out. The two
walked rapidly, pushing along with no better guide
than their sense of general direction. For a full half
hour they walked; Caleb helping Desir&eacute;e over a series
of fallen trees, gullies and boulders that neither had
noted during their outward journey.</p>

<p>Then, out of breath, Desir&eacute;e halted.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not going the right way!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;We&#8217;re going up-hill. I know we are. I can tell by
the feeling. And the camp lies down by the pond.&#8221;</p>

<p>They struck off at another angle. After ten minutes
of fast, difficult walking, through the water-thick
mist, Desir&eacute;e came again to a halt.</p>

<p>&#8220;This rock,&#8221; she declared, &#8220;is the very one I leaned
against when we stopped before. I&#8217;m certain. We&#8217;ve
been going in a circle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we were going right, in the first place,&#8221;
said Caleb. &#8220;On the way out we went up hills an&#8217;
down &#8217;em, too. Maybe if we&#8217;d kep&#8217; on going upward
we&#8217;d a come out on the hill above the camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>They started once more; going purposely upward
this time; groping their way through the blinding mist
without speaking.</p>

<p>Of a sudden the fog was gone from before them.
A step or two farther and they stood on a hilltop, under
the stars.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>Desir&eacute;e sank wearied on the stump of a twin tree,
her back against the trunk of the unfelled half. Caleb
glanced about to locate the camp. His exclamation of
wonder brought the tired girl to her feet.</p>

<p>It was no hilltop they stood on. It was a tiny island
jutting upward out of an immeasurable sea. In the
distance to either hand rose similar islets. Above was
the cloudless sky. Below, lay that vast waveless deep.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the fog!&#8221; cried the girl, finding her voice as
the marvel explained itself. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see? It lies
low, over the water and the valley. And we&#8217;re above
it. It has settled down over everything like a white
cloud. But some of the hilltops pierce the top of it.
We&#8217;re &#8216;above the clouds!&#8217;&#8221; she quoted, laughing; her
spirits coming back with her returning strength.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re above that one, anyhow,&#8221; assented Conover.
&#8220;You&#8217;re right. But where&#8217;s the camp?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Down there, somewhere,&#8221; she replied, vaguely.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how can we find it?&#8221; he urged. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
know which side of this hill it&#8217;s on. It may be five
miles away. If we go down, the chances are a million
to one we won&#8217;t strike it. An&#8217; then we&#8217;ll have to wander
&#8217;round all night in that slimy white cloud, like
we&#8217;ve been doin&#8217; for the past hour. We&#8217;re up against
it, girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t spend another hour in that mist for a
fortune,&#8221; she shuddered. &#8220;It stifled me; and hideous
woozzey faces seemed to be peering at us out of it.
I could hear invisible things whispering all around
us. Ugh!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>Caleb filled his lungs and shouted across the sea of
mist. Again and again he bellowed forth his long-drawn
halloo. To anyone on the nearer hilltop
islands his call might readily have been heard. But
human voice could as readily have penetrated a mountain
of cotton-batting as carry sound through that
waste of cloud-reek.</p>

<p>At length the two fugitives realized this. A last
shout, a final straining of ears for some answering cry;
then Conover turned again to the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t hear us a hundred yards away,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;even if they was awake. We&#8217;ll have to,&mdash;Why,
you&#8217;re shiverin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>To Desir&eacute;e the glow of the long climb was giving
place to the chill air of the Adirondack autumn night.
Her teeth were chattering; but she bravely scouted the
idea of discomfort.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in an instant Caleb had whipped off
his thick mackintosh and wrapped her in its huge folds.
She vainly protested that he must not rob himself; but
the cozy comfort of the big garment as well as his flat
refusal to let her remove it soon silenced her objections.
Conover had taken charge of the situation. It
was the work of a minute to scratch together an armful
of twigs, chips and small boughs,&mdash;relics of the
hewn tree,&mdash;to thrust under the heap a crumpled letter
from his pocket, and to set a match to the impromptu
fire.</p>

<p>Then, as the twigs crackled and blazed, he scoured
the hilltop for larger wood. Half rotted logs that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
would smoulder like peat, huge tree branches that must
be dragged instead of carried to the fire; a bulky
length of lumber overlooked when the tree had been
cut up and carted away. These and lesser fuel served
in an amazingly short time to turn the sputtering flamelets
into a roaring camp fire.</p>

<p>Piece after piece of his gathered wood Caleb fed to
the blaze; Desir&eacute;e leaning back, deliciously warm and
happy, to encourage the labor. A second journey into
the dark and Conover was back with more fuel, which
he piled in reserve beyond the reach of the flame
tongues.</p>

<p>&#8220;You work like a veteran woodsman,&#8221; she praised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why wouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221; he puffed, dragging in a new
bunch of long boughs for the reserve pile. &#8220;I had to
hustle fires an&#8217; grub for the section gang, ten months or
more, when I was a youngster. That&#8217;s why it seems
funny to me that folks should pay big money for a
chance of chasin&#8217; out to the wilderness an&#8217; doin&#8217; the
chores <i>I</i> used to get $1.85 a day for. Still, once in a
lifetime, it comes in handy to know how.&#8221;</p>

<p>The heat was fierce. Caleb drew back from the
fire, mopping his red face. Then he took off his
tweed jacket. Crossing to Desir&eacute;e, he lifted his mackintosh
from her shoulders and made her put on the
jacket. The latter&#8217;s hem fell to her knees. Conover
rolled back its sleeves until her engulfed hands were
once more visible. Then he spread the mackintosh on
the ground near the fire; incidentally dislodging Rex
from a carefully chosen bed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>&#8220;There!&#8221; proclaimed the Fighter. &#8220;<i>That&#8217;s</i> done.
Now you&#8217;ve a camp bed. Lay down on that mackintosh
an&#8217; I&#8217;ll wrap you up in it. You won&#8217;t catch
cold, even if the fire dies out. Which same it won&#8217;t;
for I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to set up an&#8217; keep it burnin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In other words,&#8221; she said with the stern air of rebuke
that he loved, &#8220;I am going to curl up in all the
wraps there are and go fast to sleep, while you sit up
all night long and keep the fire going? I think I see
myself doing it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we had a lookin&#8217; glass along,&#8221; he answered, unruffled,
&#8220;you could. As it is, you&#8217;ll just have to take
my word for it. I&#8217;ll set back on that stump where
you are now, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll have that big trunk to rest my
head on. An&#8217; I&#8217;ll sleep a blamed sight better&#8217;n I ever
do in a Pullman. When I feel cold I&#8217;ll know the fire&#8217;s
dyin&#8217; down an&#8217; I&#8217;ll get up an&#8217; tend it, an&#8217; then go to
sleep again. It&#8217;s a&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do nothing of the sort!&#8221; contradicted Desir&eacute;e.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, you little girl,&#8221; put in Caleb with rough
tenderness. &#8220;I like nothin&#8217; so well, as a rule, as to let
you boss me. But here&#8217;s the one time that <i>I&#8217;m</i> goin&#8217;
to do the bossin&#8217;. You&#8217;re tired out, an&#8217; you&#8217;re li&#8217;ble to
take cold unless you keep wrapped up an&#8217; get a good
comf&#8217;tble sleep. An&#8217; you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to get it. Don&#8217;t
you worry &#8217;bout <i>me</i>, neither. By the time I&#8217;ve been
restin&#8217; &#8217;gainst that tree trunk five minutes I&#8217;ll be in the
arms of old Morpheus. It seems a kind of measly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
trick to put up on Morpheus, whoever he may be. But
it&#8217;s what I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The quiet mastery of the man permitted no argument.
Indeed, Desir&eacute;e for some strange reason felt
herself unaccountably stirred by it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;one more armful of this stuff
on the pile an&#8217; then I&#8217;ll warm the mackintosh for you
by the fire an&#8217; let you go to sleep. I wish I&#8217;d wore a
vest to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? Oh, you&#8217;re cold! You need this&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;d like it to roll up into a pillow for you.
I&#8217;m warm, all right. An&#8217; this fire&#8217;ll stay goin&#8217; all
night if I feed it up once or twice before mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>He picked up one of the longer boughs and swung it
onto the blaze. The sweep of his arm sent the end of
the branch against Desir&eacute;e. She was rising from her
tree-stump seat, at the moment; and the impact of the
strong-swung bushy end of the bough threw her off
her balance. Not in the least hurt, she nevertheless
lost her footing and fell, with an exclamation of dismay,
to the ground.</p>

<p>At her cry, Caleb turned. Realizing that he had
knocked her down and fearful lest she be badly bruised
by the blow, he sprang forward; and with a volley of
loud self-reproach, lifted her to her feet.</p>

<p>The grip of his powerful arms gave Desir&eacute;e a sense
of utter peace and protection. That and something
more. Something she could not&mdash;would not&mdash;analyze.
Unresisting, she let her body rest inert in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
mighty grasp the fraction of an instant longer than was
perhaps really needful.</p>

<p>And in that atom of time the mischief was made.</p>

<p>Conover was staring down at her in eager solicitude;
still begging her to tell him if she were hurt. She
looked up, and their eyes met. Hers were sick with a
love that transfigured her. And before their gaze,
Conover&#8217;s heavy face went blank; then filled with a
light of wonder and utter rapture that fairly frightened
the girl.</p>

<p>His arms tightened about her in a clasp that robbed
her of breath,&mdash;and of all will to breathe. She felt
herself crushed against the man&#8217;s chest, and her upturned
face was buried in fierce ecstatic kisses. Kisses
wildly awkward and vehement; those of a man unused
to giving or receiving caresses. Kisses that kindled in
the girl a swift bliss that blinded,&mdash;enthralled her.</p>

<p>For a moment Desir&eacute;e stood moveless, leaning back
limply in the iron arms that bound her to her lover&#8217;s
breast. His kisses rained down on her rapt, white
face; upon her wide, starry eyes, her loosened hair.</p>

<p>Then, with a gasping murmur of joy she could not
put into words, she suddenly threw her arms about
Conover&#8217;s thick neck and gave him kiss for kiss. The
rank scent of tobacco upon his lips,&mdash;the bristle of a
day-old beard,&mdash;the ugly face itself with its undershot
jaw, its square, crude massiveness,&mdash;all these
things were nothing. Behind them she read and gloried
in the love that blazed in the Fighter&#8217;s pale eyes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
That was all she saw,&mdash;had ever seen,&mdash;would ever
see.</p>

<p>Whether for a minute or for a century the two
stood clasped heart to heart, soul to soul, neither could
ever remember. At last the great arms released her.
The triumphant love that shone in Conover&#8217;s face was
again tinged with a wonder that was almost reverence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why in blazes didn&#8217;t we know this before?&#8221; he
demanded, hoarse and shaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak for yourself!&#8221; sobbed the girl. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
known it always, always, <i>always</i>! Ever since I was a
child. Every minute since then. There&#8217;s just been
<i>you</i>! Nothing else counted. And&mdash;and you
never&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never cared?&#8221; he guessed. &#8220;Girl, I&#8217;ve cared so
much it was the life of me. An&#8217; because it was the
life I lived n&#8217; the breath I breathed, I didn&#8217;t even
guess it. Never once. Oh it&#8217;s like I&#8217;d been trav&#8217;lin&#8217;
through heaven blin&#8217;folded. Why didn&#8217;t you <i>tell</i> me?
Why wasn&#8217;t it like this two years ago? Dey, if I&#8217;d
known&mdash;if I&#8217;d understood I felt that way &#8217;bout you,
I&#8217;d a&#8217;&mdash;no, I wouldn&#8217;t, either. I&#8217;d a kep&#8217; away for
fear of breakin&#8217; my heart. For it wouldn&#8217;t a&#8217; seemed
possible you could love me. <i>Say</i> you love me, girl!&#8221;
he ordered, fiercely. &#8220;Say it over an&#8217; over&mdash;a lot of
times!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Love you?&#8221; murmured Desir&eacute;e, her sobs dying
away. &#8220;<i>Love</i> you?&mdash;Why,&mdash;!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a sudden passion of adoration she flung her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
arms again about his neck, straining him close to her.
She could not speak. She could only press her soft,
hot face close&mdash;ever so close&mdash;to his rough cheek;
and cling fast to him as though she feared he might
vanish, dreamlike, from her clasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you went away,&#8221; he continued after a divine
silence, &#8220;it was like the heart of me had been
torn out. I didn&#8217;t know what ailed me. I thought it
was a craze to work. An&#8217; I worked till I set all Granite
to totterin&#8217;. An&#8217; all the time it was you,&mdash;<i>you</i>!
Then when I saw you again, there at the station in the
mist, it seemed like I&#8217;d come home. I wanted to catch
hold of your dress an&#8217; beg you never to get out of my
sight again. An&#8217; I was ashamed of feelin&#8217; that way,
an&#8217; I was afraid you&#8217;d find out an&#8217; laugh at me. I was
wild in <i>love</i> with you, girl,&mdash;an&#8217; I never knew it. Did&mdash;did
<i>you</i> know I was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I always knew it,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;I knew you
loved me. That you cared almost as much as I cared.
But you never even suspected. And,&mdash;oh, how could
<i>I</i> tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again they were silent for a space. Then she said,
a little timidly:</p>

<p>&#8220;God meant us for each other, dear love. I believe
in such things. And so must you. And we
have found each other at last. Here, alone, on the
top of the world. Just as He meant us to. Oh, I
must be good&mdash;so good&mdash;if I am to deserve all
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Deserve it?&#8221; he echoed in choked amaze. &#8220;Girl,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
you make me feel like hidin&#8217; my head somewheres.
What is there in all this for <i>you</i>? I&#8217;m a rough, uneddicated
chap that most folks look down on, an&#8217; the
rest don&#8217;t look at, at all. I got nothin&#8217; but my money
an&#8217;&mdash;Oh, Dey, I got <i>you</i>! An&#8217; I&#8217;m the happiest man
that ever got lost in this measly, heavenly wilderness.
It ain&#8217;t true. An&#8217; presently I&#8217;ll wake up. But while
it lasts&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will last forever, darling,&#8221; she interposed.
&#8220;Forever and a day. We couldn&#8217;t be brought together
like this, just to be parted again. Even Fate
couldn&#8217;t be as cruel as that. Tell me why you didn&#8217;t
know you loved me. Sometimes, when you used to
talk about marrying&mdash;someone else,&mdash;I had to bite
my lips to keep from calling to you&mdash;&#8216;You <i>can&#8217;t</i>!
It&#8217;s <i>I</i> you love!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you, then? You saw me stumblin&#8217;
along in the dark. Why did you let me do it, when if
you&#8217;d said the first word&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have said it some day. I know I should.
Some day before it was too late. Oh, beloved, did you
really think I was going to let you marry&mdash;her?
Why even <i>she</i> knew better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Conover threw back his head and laughed long and
loud. A laugh of absolute boyish happiness that rang
out over the miles of fog like a challenge to Fate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord!&#8221; he gurgled. &#8220;Gener&#8217;lly it gets me
wild to be made a fool of. But this is the dandiest
joke ever. The whole crowd was on, you say?
Ev&#8217;rybody but me!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>He grew grave and drew her to him once more.
Not impetuously now, but with a gentle reverence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sweetheart,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t fit to kiss one of
those soaked little mocc&#8217;sins of yours. I never worried
much, before, &#8217;bout such things;&mdash;but now&mdash;I
kind of wish I&#8217;d done diff&#8217;rent in lots of things; so&#8217;s I
could tell you I was reely worth your marryin&#8217;. But
if you&#8217;ll help me, Dey, I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to be everything
you&#8217;d want. An&#8217; one of these days I&#8217;ll make you
proud of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m prouder of you now, dear,&mdash;and I&#8217;ve always
been prouder&mdash;than I could be of any other man
alive,&#8221; she insisted. &#8220;Oh, the miracle of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Before he could stay her, or so much as guess her
intent, she had slipped to her knees. Stooping to
raise her, he saw her hands were clasped and her lips
moving. Awed, he drew back a pace, and looked
timidly upward into the Star Country. Then, shutting
his eyes very tight he opened communication with
Heaven for the first and last time in his life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks!&#8221; he muttered under his breath.</p>

<p>A pause of mental hiatus,&mdash;a helpless groping for
words in a wild universe of incoherent gratitude;&mdash;then
once more a mumbled, shy &#8220;Thanks!&#8221;&mdash;and the
prayer,&mdash;two words in all,&mdash;was ended.</p>

<p>It is possible that longer, more eloquent orisons than
his have penetrated less far beyond the frontier of the
stars and less close to the ear of the Hearer and Answerer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>Desir&eacute;e had risen. Simply, half-shyly, like two little
children, they kissed each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you must go to sleep,&#8221; he ordered, picking
up the mackintosh and wrapping it closely about her.</p>

<p>&#8220;To sleep!&#8221; she echoed. &#8220;After <i>this</i>? I don&#8217;t
think I shall ever throw away happy hours again by
sleeping through them. I couldn&#8217;t sleep now to save
my life, even if I wanted to. And I don&#8217;t want to.
Please let me do the bossing just a <i>little</i> longer, dear
heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had flung another armful of wood upon the fire.
Now, picking Desir&eacute;e up as he might have lifted a
baby, he returned to the stump seat. Holding her in
his arms, close to his breast, he sat there, and gazed
into the flames.</p>

<p>Tired, deliriously content, she nestled to him with a
sigh of absolute rapture. There they remained; still;
ineffably beatific; at rest; while the fire snapped merrily
and the dog at their feet growlingly pursued numberless
coveys of low-flying partridges through the
aisles of dreamland. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose I&#8217;ll ever reely understand it,&#8221; mused
Caleb. &#8220;Here I&#8217;ve always been thinkin&#8217; I looked on
you like you were my daughter an&#8217; that I was a million
years older&#8217;n you&#8217;d ever get to be. An&#8217; now in just
one second the whole world turns inside out, an&#8217; I land
in heaven; I&#8217;m talkin&#8217; &#8217;bout &#8216;heaven&#8217; to-night like any
sky-scout, ain&#8217;t I? But it sort of seems the only
word.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>&#8220;It is very near us,&#8221; she made reply, softly.
&#8220;See,&#8221; raising herself in his arms and looking out
over the star-gleaming mists below them. &#8220;See, the
world is new. The seas have swept over all its old
sins and follies and sordid workaday life. This
island stands alone in the universe. All the rest is engulfed.
And you and I are the only people on God&#8217;s
new earth. We have risen above the old life of mistakes
and blindness. Here,&mdash;alone&mdash;in our new
marvel world,&mdash;forever and ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her head sank on his breast. He buried his face in
the fragrant wonder of her hair. And once more they
fell silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t a thing I won&#8217;t do for you, girl,&#8221; went
on Conover, by and by. &#8220;All by myself I&#8217;ve got rich
an&#8217; I&#8217;ve won ev&#8217;ry fight I&#8217;ve made. With you to
work for I&#8217;ll hammer away at Old Man Dest&#8217;ny till
I&#8217;ve got the whole State in my vest pocket. Yes, an&#8217;
I&#8217;ll try for the White House, too, before I&#8217;m done; if
you&#8217;d like me to. We&#8217;re goin&#8217; to build the biggest,
most expensive house, right off, that was ever put up
in Granite. We&#8217;ll build it on Pompton Av&#8217;noo, right
in the thick of the swells. White marble we&#8217;ll make
it. An&#8217; you&#8217;ll have all the servants an&#8217; horses an&#8217;
joolry an&#8217; everything else you want. There won&#8217;t be a
thing money can buy that you can&#8217;t have. I&#8217;ll fight
the whole world till I&#8217;ve piled up such a fortune as&#8217;ll
make those great big eyes of yours dazzled. An&#8217; it&#8217;ll
all be for <i>you</i>. All <i>yours</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You darling old schoolboy!&#8221; she laughed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
&#8220;Even your daydreams are studded with dollar signs.
What do you suppose I care for such things? I have
<i>you</i>, and we&#8217;re to be together always and always.
What else could I want? And, dear,&#8221; more gravely,
&#8220;I&#8217;d rather we stayed just as we are and not try for
more wealth or more power. I seem to see such things
in a new way to-night. Every dollar you win, every
forward step in fame or fortune that you take, may
mean unhappiness for someone who is less lucky.
And, we are so happy, heart of mine, that we can
surely let others be happy, too. Can&#8217;t we? Let us
be content where we stand. You are so rich already
that everyone envies you. Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s turn that envy
into hatred by wringing more from people who already
have less than we. It will make me so much
comfortabler to feel we are using our wealth for happiness.
Both for our own and for other peoples&#8217;.
Am I talking like a goody-goody Sunday School
teacher? I don&#8217;t mean to. But I know my way is
best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always best,&#8221; he agreed after a moment.
&#8220;An&#8217; even if it wasn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s <i>your</i> way; and so it goes.
We&#8217;ll do whatever you say. It&#8217;ll seem queer to stop
fightin&#8217;. But,&mdash;it&#8217;ll seem nice, too. I never thought
I&#8217;d feel that way. But I do now. An&#8217; I always shall,
while you&#8217;re by me. You can do anything you want
to with me. You always could, an&#8217; you always can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your arms are so big&mdash;so strong,&#8221; murmured
Desir&eacute;e. &#8220;I seem to be in a fortress where no ill can
ever get to me. I&#8217;m <i>home</i>!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>He wrapped the coat more closely about her and
held her tenderly as a mother, reverently as a priest
might bear the Host. And after a time, as she lay
against his broad breast, the long curling fringe of
her eyelashes began to waver. Sleepily she lifted her
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kiss me goodnight,&#8221; she said, her voice slow with
drowsiness.</p>

<p>The fire died down and the ring of heat-ramparts
it had reared against the autumn cold crumbled
away. The sleeping girl rested cozily warm in Conover&#8217;s
arms. The man, his back against the tree, sat
motionless; fearing by the slightest move to disturb
her sleep.</p>

<p>He dared not rise to replenish the smouldering fire.
He was coatless, and the growing cold gnawed with
increasing keenness through the thin n&eacute;glig&eacute;e shirt,
into his arms and shoulders. It was the coldest night
he had known since his arrival at the Adirondacks.</p>

<p>As the last flame died down upon the bed of red-gray
coals, Rex woke with a quiver of chilliness, crept
close to the embers and lay down again. Caleb, first
making sure the movement had not disturbed Desir&eacute;e,
fell to envying the dog. The cold had sank into his
very bones. The impossibility of shifting his stilted
position galled him, as the endless hours crept by.
Cramped, half frozen, racked with the agony of stiffening
muscles and of blood that could no longer
circulate, he clenched his teeth over his underlip from
sheer pain. The girl, who at first had lain feather-like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
in his arms, now seemed heavy enough to tear
loose his throbbing biceps. Nor would he, for all the
physical anguish of his plight, move her body one hair&#8217;s
breadth.</p>

<p>And so, like a sleepless Galahad before some old-world
forest shrine,&mdash;like Stylites on his pillar,&mdash;worshipping
yet in infinite suffering,&mdash;he sat the long
night through.</p>

<p>At length his body grew numb, his blood congested.
Aching discomfort and cold had wrought their worst
on his frame of iron and had left it hardily impervious
to further ill. His mind, when bodily surcease came,
awoke to new activity. His thoughts, at first disjointed
and wonderingly happy, settled down soon to
their wonted sharp clearness. Then it was he coolly
weighed this thing he had done.</p>

<p>It was like him to array in battle-order all the contrary
arguments of the case; that with the brute force
of his domination he might batter them to pieces. And
a long array they were.</p>

<p>First,&mdash;his own social yearnings, his golden
dreams of a secure place within the inner charmed
circle of Granite society! The only road of ingress
had been through marriage with a daughter of that
circle. Preferably with Letty Standish. Now all that
was out of the question. Desir&eacute;e herself was popular.
But he knew she could not drag up to social prominence
a man like himself. She had not family nor
other prestige for such a tremendous uplift. Nor, as
she herself had said, did she value such position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>Had she married Hawarden, Caine or any of a half
dozen other eligible Granite men, Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s own place
in society would straightway have become more than
assured. With Conover as a husband, she must take
rank&mdash;or lack of rank&mdash;with him. Nothing higher
could be in store for her. Forever, Caleb must assail
the circle in vain, or else sink back content with his
own lot far outside its radius.</p>

<p>The very fact that he was married,&mdash;and married
to an outsider who would not second his attack,&mdash;would
render the walls of society impregnable against
him. As a single man,&mdash;with money and with the
power to use the money as a battering ram,&mdash;he had
already knocked great breaches in the fortifications.
Now he could never pass triumphant through those
gaps.</p>

<p>A life-ambition,&mdash;all-compelling even if unworthy
of a strong man,&mdash;was wilfully to be foregone. He,
who had ever fought with all that was within him for
the gratification of his few desires, must now forever
abandon the earliest and greatest of them all. On the
very eve of his career&#8217;s most complete victory he must
for all time lay aside the sword.</p>

<p>Something like a sigh broke from between his blue-cold
lips. The sound made the girl stir ever so
slightly in her sleep. Caleb glanced down in alarm,
dreading lest he had broken her slumber. There,
against his arm rested Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s upturned face. The
dark silken lashes lay peacefully above the sleep-flushed
cheeks. She was so little, so helpless, so wonderful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
to the eyes bending above her! Inexpressibly precious
to him always; a thousand-fold more so, now, in the
hour of his renunciation of all else for love of her.</p>

<p>A wave of undreamed-of tenderness swept over
Conover; possessing him to the utter extinction of
every other thought or passion; sweeping away in its
headlong rush all vestige of doubts and regrets. In
an instant of blinding soul-light he saw once and for
all the futility of what he had abandoned; the God-given
marvel of what he had won in its place.</p>

<p>The battle was over. Caleb Conover had lost&mdash;and
won. In his heart he knew he was no longer the
Fighter; no more a seeker for Dead-Sea Fruit. His
battles, social and financial, were at an end. This
coming clash at the Legislature,&mdash;this mission on
which Desir&eacute;e was dispatching him, her true knight,
to save the fortunes of others,&mdash;should be his last
field. After that, a new, strange peace!&mdash;and Desir&eacute;e!</p>

<p>Defiantly, Conover glared out into the night, beyond
the smoking remnant of the fire; as though challenging
the ghosts of slain ambitions to rise again before
him that he might confound them all by merely pointing
at the girl who slept in his arms. She&mdash;the mere
sight of her&mdash;should be his reply to their taunts.</p>

<p>Something in his own look or attitude stirred a latent
chord of memory. He recalled, by an odd turn of
thought, a double-page drawing in one of the English
weeklies that he had long ago seen at Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s:&mdash;</p>

<p>A rocky hillock whereon sat a man clad in skins;&mdash;in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
his arms an unconscious woman whose long hair
streamed over her loose robe;&mdash;confronting the twain
a shadowy, armored goddess into whose commanding
eyes the skin-clad man was staring with an awed courage
born of desperation. Beneath the picture were the
lines:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>So gr&uuml;sse mir Walhall! Gr&uuml;sse mir Wotan!
Gr&uuml;sse mir W&auml;lse und alle Helden! Zu ihnen folg&#8217;
ich dir nicht!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Desir&eacute;e had translated the words for Caleb. She
had told him the pictured man was Siegmund; who,
pausing in his flight to a place of refuge, with the
fainting Sieglinde whom he loved, beheld the Valkyr,
Brunhilde, and was told by her that a hero&#8217;s death
and a hero&#8217;s reward in Valhalla were in store for him.
There in the Viking Paradise, waited the warrior-parent
he had lost; there Wotan the All-Father would
welcome him. The Valkyries were preparing his
place. The heroes of olden days would be his boon
companions.</p>

<p>And Siegmund, the Luckless, heard with joy. But
one question he asked the goddess:&mdash;Would Sieglinde,
his fellow fugitive, join him in that abode of the
blest? Brunhilde scoffingly replied that Valhalla was
for heroes; not for mere women. Then, unflinchingly
casting aside his every hope of Paradise, Siegmund
kissed the senseless woman&#8217;s brow; and, again
facing the goddess, made answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;Greet for me Valhalla! Greet for me Wotan!
Greet for me my father and all the heroes! To them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
I&#8217;ll follow thee not! Where Sieglinde bides, there
shall Siegmund stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caleb at the time had been but mildly interested in
the tale. The fact that Desir&eacute;e could translate such
queer-looking words was to him the most noteworthy
feature of the whole affair. Now, with a whimsical
comparison to his own case, the incident recurred to
him.</p>

<p>Was he not, like Siegmund, keeping watch and ward
in the wilderness over the unconscious woman of his
heart? Was not the Brunhilde of ambition standing
there somewhere in the mystic star-shadows before
him, pointing out all that might be his were he to renounce
love? And was he not making reply as defiantly,
if perhaps not in quite such highflown terms, as
had that Dutch chap in the bearskin clothes?</p>

<p>The idea tickled Conover&#8217;s torpid imagination; he
dwelt upon it with some pride at his own powers of
analogy. Then he fell to dreaming of his vast new
happiness, of the golden vista that stretched before
him and Desir&eacute;e. And again a wonder, almost holy,
filled his heart.</p>

<p>The night voices ceased. Brunhilde, piqued at such
unwonted obstinacy from one who had ever heretofore
been her slave, had scuttled back to Valhalla in
a fine fit of rage; leaving this latter day Siegmund and
Sieglinde to their own foolish, self-chosen fate. The
cold pressed in more and more cruelly as the night
waned. It pierced at times through Caleb&#8217;s numbness.
He had great ado to keep his teeth from chattering so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
loudly as to wake the exhausted girl on his breast.
The stars grew dim. The dawn-wind breathed
across the sky. A paleness crept over the eastern
horizon of the fog-sea. The man&#8217;s heavy head
nodded;&mdash;once&mdash;and again,&mdash;then hung still.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With a sensation of being stared at, Caleb Conover
opened his eyes. The pale shimmer in the east had
given place to gray dawn. The dawn-wind, too, had
waxed stronger; sweeping the fog before it. No
longer were the man and woman on an island; but on
a hilltop whence on every side stretched away leagues
of dull green landscape. Only over the pond did the
mist still hover. Directly below, not a quarter mile
away, lay the camp.</p>

<p>Nor were they alone on their wonder-hill. On the
far side of the dead fire Jack Hawarden stood eyeing
them. And his face was as gray and as lifeless as
the strewn ashes at his feet.</p>

<p>Conover and the lad looked at each other without
speaking. Long and expressionlessly Jack gazed at
the waking and the sleeping. Conover noted that the
boy&#8217;s eyes were haggard and that the youth and jollity
had been stricken from his face as by a blow. It was
Hawarden who spoke first:</p>

<p>&#8220;No one down there is awake yet,&#8221; he said, whispering
so low that the girl&#8217;s slumber was not broken.
&#8220;I woke up and missed you. I came out of the tent
and saw you up here. I didn&#8217;t know when you would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
wake and I was afraid the others might see. So I
came. Don&#8217;t let her know.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a catch in his breath at the last words.
He turned abruptly on his heel and sped down the hillside;
his stockinged feet making no sound on the damp
mold. Caleb looked dazedly after his receding figure.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s white,&#8221; muttered Conover. &#8220;White, clear
through!&#8221;</p>

<p>Desir&eacute;e moved at sound of his voice, and opened
her eyes. For a moment she gazed up into Caleb&#8217;s
face with blank amaze. Then she knew. Up went
her arms, like a waking baby&#8217;s, and about his neck.
As he bent to kiss her the agony of his stiffened muscles
wellnigh made him cry out.</p>

<p>Flushed, laughing, big-eyed from her long sleep, Desir&eacute;e
sprang to her feet. Her glance caught the white
gleam of the tents below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh what luck!&#8221; she exclaimed, delightedly.
&#8220;Not a soul astir! We can get back without anyone
knowing. What time is it? Or has time stopped
being?&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose to feel for his watch;&mdash;rose, and toppled
clumsily to his knees. His benumbed body refused to
obey the will that was never numb. But, mumbling
something about having tripped over a root, he forced
himself to rise and to put his torturing muscles into
motion.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re cold!&#8221; she cried, accusingly. &#8220;The fire&#8217;s
out and&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>&#8220;Not a bit of it,&#8221; he denied, compelling his teeth
not to chatter. &#8220;I&#8217;m as warm as toast. Never felt
spryer in my life. Say, girl,&#8221; he went on, to turn the
subject from his own acute ills, &#8220;you&#8217;ve had your
wish, all right. You said you wanted to give the
slip to a Simon Legree chap named Conventionality.
An&#8217; I guess we done it.&#8221;</p>

<p>His arm about her, her hands clasped over one of
his aching shoulders, they made their way down the
hillside to the silent camp in the waterside dusk below.</p>

<small>CALEB CONOVER RECEIVES NEWS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The night train &#8220;out,&#8221; full of brown and disgruntled
returning vacationists, drew away from Raquette
Lake Station. Caleb, in the smoking room, his hat
pulled over his eyes, his eternal cigar unlighted, sat
with shut lids, trying to summon up the memory of
Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s big brave eyes as she had bidden him goodbye
on the dock. Instead, he could only recall the
sweatered, cloaked crowd at the Antlers pier, waiting
in the lantern-light to say goodbye to the launchful
of departing guests; the two or three cards that had
been thrust into his hand,&mdash;and of whose purport he
had not the remotest idea; the screech of the launch-whistle,
and the churning out of the boat into the dark;
dragging Caleb away from the happiest hours of all his
life.</p>

<p>A man he had met at the Antlers entered the smoking
room and tried to talk to him. Conover&#8217;s answers
were so vague and disjointed that the other soon gave
over the attempt. A fellow railroad-magnate from a
camp near the lake glanced in at the door and nodded
affably to the rising power in the provincial railroad
world. Conover did not so much as see the greeting.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
He was trying once more, with shut eyes, to conjure
up Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>He stopped over a train, in New York, next morning;
took a cab to the store of a famous Fifth Avenue
jeweler and demanded to see an assortment of engagement
rings. The clerk laid on a velvet cushion
half a dozen diamond solitaires averaging in size from
one to two karats and variously set. Caleb waved
the collection aside, after a single glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want the biggest, best diamond ring you got in
the place,&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>A second, far more garish array was produced.
Caleb chose from it a diamond of the size of his
thumb-nail, looked it over critically and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;This&#8217;ll do, I guess. Biggest you&#8217;ve got? How
much?&#8221;</p>

<p>At the astounding price named he merely smiled,
and drew out his check book.</p>

<p>&#8220;That ought to tickle her fancy,&#8221; he mused.
&#8220;Ain&#8217;t a di&#8217;mond in Granite as big.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What size, sir?&#8221; asked the clerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, <i>that&#8217;s</i> the one I&#8217;m takin&#8217;. That size,&#8221; replied
Conover, perplexed.</p>

<p>The clerk explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; stammered Caleb. &#8220;I&mdash;I didn&#8217;t
think to ask her. I didn&#8217;t even know fingers went by
sizes. But&mdash;her hand&#8217;s a lot smaller&#8217;n mine, if that&#8217;ll
help you any.&#8221;</p>

<p>The clerk looked away at some point of interest
that had suddenly sprung into his vision at a remote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
part of the store. Caleb picked up the huge diamond
and began to fit the ring on his own fingers. His little
finger alone would permit the circlet to slip down as far
as the first bulging knuckle-joint.</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t even go on my little finger,&#8221; he observed.
&#8220;I guess that&#8217;ll be just &#8217;bout the right size for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I might suggest,&#8221; offered the clerk, &#8220;why don&#8217;t
you leave the ring with me until you can find out the
size of the lady&#8217;s finger? Then notify us and we will
have it adjusted at once and forwarded to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>This in no way suited Caleb&#8217;s ideas. He had
planned to put the ring on Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s hand, the evening
of her return to Granite, three weeks hence. He
wanted to witness her delight and surprise. It would
offset the incident of the American Beauties. Neither
of them had said a word during that last, all-too-short
day, about an engagement ring. He hoped she would
think he did not know enough to get her one. The
girl&#8217;s amazement and joy would be so much the
greater. Whereas, if he asked her beforehand about
the size&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he decided. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take it with
me. If it don&#8217;t fit she can send it back. But I guess
it will.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was the eve of the Legislature&#8217;s special session.
Conover had moved, three days earlier, to the Capital
and was massing his legislative cohorts for the charge
which was forever to annihilate the revised Starke
bill.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>The price of Steeloids had slumped ever so little in
view of the coming test. Caleb welcomed the slight
drop; assuring Caine, Standish and the rest that it
but preluded an unheard of &#8220;boom&#8221; in the stock the
moment the result of the Assembly vote became known
on &#8217;Change. As to that result he had not an atom of
doubt. He knew his strength to the minutest degree.
Blacarda had made inroads upon his ranks, it was true;
but the breaches were unimportant. And Caleb&#8217;s
presence in the lobby on the day of the vote, together
with certain highly effective secret man&#339;uvres which
were to be put into operation that day, would far more
than offset them. Compared to the victorious struggle
of six months earlier, he prophesied, this second
affair would be no contest, but a rout.</p>

<p>The time was long since past when any of Caleb&#8217;s
financial beneficiaries could receive the lightest of their
leader&#8217;s forecasts with doubt. Hence the Steeloid
ring rejoiced mightily; and plunged so heavily in the
stock that the price took a swift preliminary climb
even before its promised rise was due.</p>

<p>Caine, and more than one other of Conover&#8217;s business
associates wondered at the subtle change that two
weeks of absence had wrought in their champion. He
was as shrewd, as daring, as resourceful as ever.
Yet there was a difference. Caine voiced the general
opinion when he said to Standish, the day the Assembly
opened:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I believed in miracles I should fancy a stray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
grain of humanity had somehow found its way into
the man&#8217;s brain.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first day&#8217;s session of the Assembly was given
over to the usual formalities. On the morning of the
second, so Conover&#8217;s agent in the enemy&#8217;s camp reported
that night, Blacarda intended to put forward
his bill. Caleb was well prepared for the issue. One
thing only puzzled him. Knowing Blacarda as he
did, he could not understand why the man had tried
no subterfuge this time, to draw his arch-opponent
away from the scene of action. That such a trick
could be attempted without Conover&#8217;s learning of it
seemed impossible. Yet no tidings of the sort had
reached him. And it was not like Blacarda to go into
battle against a stronger foe without trying to weaken
the odds against himself.</p>

<p>These things Caleb was pondering in his hotel room,
early on the evening before the Starke bill was to be
presented. He was dressing to go with Caine to a
conference of political and business associates, to be
held a mile or so distant. And, as he made ready to
start out, the answer to his conjecture was received.</p>

<p>It came in the form of a telegram:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<i>Train derailed near Magdeburg. Miss Shevlin
badly injured. At Magdeburg hotel. Wire instructions
and come by next train. Dangerous.</i></p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<i>J. Hawarden, Jr.</i>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>For the briefest of intervals Conover&#8217;s blood settled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
down stiflingly upon his heart. Then he laughed in
grim relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought Friend Blacarda was too sharp to try
the same trick twice on me,&#8221; he growled, handing the
dispatch to Caine, &#8220;an&#8217; I thought he&#8217;d be afraid to.
Seems I was wrong. He knew Dey was at the Antlers
with the Hawardens, of course. But he might a&#8217;
took the pains to find out she wasn&#8217;t goin&#8217; to leave
there for a fortnight. I had a letter from her, there,
to-day. An&#8217; any railroad man could a&#8217; told him,&#8221; he
went on contemptuously, &#8220;that no train either from
Noo York or the Ad&#8217;rondacks passes through Magdeburg.
But most likely he chose that because it&#8217;s an
out-of-the-way hole that takes f&#8217;ever to get to. Why
couldn&#8217;t he a&#8217; flattered my intelligence by a fake that
had a little cleverness in it? Come on. We&#8217;ll be late
to that meetin&#8217;. I&#8217;ll settle once more with Blacarda,
afterward. An&#8217; this time he won&#8217;t forget so soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I doubt if Blacarda had any hand in it,&#8221; said
Caine, as they left the hotel. &#8220;There are only two
general divisions of the <i>genus</i> &#8216;Fool.&#8217; And Blacarda
belongs to the species that doesn&#8217;t put his fingers in the
same flame a second time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean you think there&#8217;s a ghost of a
chance the tel&#8217;gram&#8217;s the reel thing? If I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; soothed Caine. &#8220;As you&#8217;ve shown, it&#8217;s
a palpable fraud. But there are others beside Blacarda
who want the Starke bill to go through. The
story of his ruse last spring has gone abroad in spite
of Blacarda&#8217;s attempt to strangle it. And someone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
remembering how well the trick worked then, has tried
its effect a second time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put some of my men on the track of it to-morrow,&#8221;
answered Caleb. &#8220;By the time they&#8217;re
through, I guess there won&#8217;t be many crooks left in
the State who&#8217;ll dare to use Dey Shevlin&#8217;s name in
their fake mess&#8217;ges. Maybe you&#8217;re right &#8217;bout its not
bein&#8217; Blacarda himself. I&#8217;m kind of glad, too. He&#8217;ll
get enough gruellin&#8217; to-morrow without any extrys
thrown in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor old Blacarda! I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll take away
his perpetual grievance against you and leave him
nothing but grief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grievance!&#8221; scoffed Conover. &#8220;He&#8217;s got no
grievance. All&#8217;s he&#8217;s got is a grouch. There&#8217;s all
the diff&#8217;rence in the world between the two. A white
man with sense may have a grievance. But only a
sorehead an&#8217; a fool will let their grievance sour into a
grouch. Blacarda&#8217;s grouch against me is doin&#8217; him
more harm than all my moves could. He hates me.
That&#8217;s where he makes his mistake. Hate&#8217;s the heaviest
handicap a feller can carry into a fight. If you&#8217;ve
got a grievance against a man or want to get the best
of him, don&#8217;t ever spoil your chances by hatin&#8217; him.
It won&#8217;t do him any hurt, an&#8217; it&#8217;ll play the dickens
with your own brain an&#8217; nerves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; queried Caine ironically, &#8220;there was
no hatred in your attack on Blacarda in his hotel room
last spring? Pure, high-souled justice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; grumbled Caleb. &#8220;It was hate. An&#8217; I got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
it out of my system the quickest, easiest way I could.
If I&#8217;d bottled all that up an&#8217; let it ferment till now,
I&#8217;d be layin&#8217; awake nights, losing sleep an&#8217; health an&#8217;
nerve while I figgered out how cute he&#8217;d look with his
throat cut from ear to ear. As it is, I&#8217;ve no more
hard feelin&#8217; about crushin&#8217; Blacarda than I&#8217;d have if
he was a perfec&#8217; stranger. Yes, son, hate harms the
hater a lot more&#8217;n it harms the hatee. You can bank
on that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if young Hawarden will agree with your
peaceful doctrine,&#8221; hazarded Caine, &#8220;when he hears
how some financial heeler has taken his name in vain
in that telegram?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll most likely hunt the feller up an&#8217; lick him,&#8221;
responded Conover. &#8220;He&#8217;s all right, that boy is.
I&#8217;ve took a shine to him. Pity he ain&#8217;t got some
commonsense ambition instead of hankerin&#8217; after litterchoor.
Kind of petty trade for a grown man, ain&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; dissented Caine. &#8220;I should call slow starvation
one of the big things of life. There&#8217;s nothing
petty about it that I can see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the answer, hey? He told me &#8217;bout a feller
he&#8217;d met once at the Antlers who made twenty thousan&#8217;
a year just by writin&#8217; novels &#8217;bout s&#8217;ciety. Now,
Hawarden knows all &#8217;bout the s&#8217;ciety game. I sh&#8217;d
think he&#8217;d write such stories fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The stories of Jack&#8217;s that I&#8217;ve read,&#8221; answered
Caine, &#8220;all centre around labor problems and other
things the boy knows as little about as if he had taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
a postgraduate course in ignorance. He couldn&#8217;t
write a society story if he tried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? I sh&#8217;d think&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he&#8217;s been born and brought up in that atmosphere.
A society man could no more write about
society than he could write a love sonnet to his own
sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that kind of stories get written,&#8221; faltered
Caleb, grubbing vainly for a possible jest in his friend&#8217;s
puzzling dictum. &#8220;<i>Somebody</i> must write &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; denied Caine. &#8220;Nobodies
write them. For instance, there is a man who was
born in South Brooklyn or somewhere; and spent a
year or two in Europe. So much for his environment.
He used to write charming stories. They
were fairly vibrant with satire, humor, color and a
ceaseless rush of action. His nature-descriptions were
revelations in word-painting. I always read every line
he wrote. So did some other people. But only <i>some</i>.
Then he moved to a little village, away from the centre
of things, and forthwith began to write novels of New
York Society.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was very easy. The Sunday papers cost him
no more than they cost anyone else. He fell to describing
the innermost life of New York&#8217;s innermost
smart set. He scorned to depict a single character that
wasn&#8217;t worth at least a million. Silver, cut glass and
diamonds strewed his pages; till one longed for brown
bread and pie. He flashed the fierce white light of
unbiased ignorance into the darkest corners of a society<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
that never was by sea or land. And what was the result?
In a day he leaped to immortality. The shop-girl
read him so eagerly that she rode past her station.
The youth behind the counter learned to rattle off the
list of his books as easily as the percentages of the
base ball-clubs. In the walks of life that he so vividly
portrayed, such people as read at all made amused comments
that could never by any possibility reach his
ears. We others who had reveled in his earlier books
felt as we might if an adored brother has left the diplomatic
service to become a bartender. But we were
in the minority. So we re-read Browning&#8217;s &#8216;Lost
Leader,&#8217; dropped the subject and sought in vain for a
new idol.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose so,&#8221; agreed Caleb, hazily, recalling his
wandered attention as Caine paused. &#8220;I wish I hadn&#8217;t
got that tel&#8217;gram.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was after midnight when Caleb Conover returned
to his room. Three more telegrams awaited him, as
well as a penciled request that he call up Magdeburg
Hotel on the long-distance telephone. While he was
profanely waiting for the operator to establish the connection,
Caleb ripped open the telegrams one after the
other. All were from Jack. Each bore the same
burden as the message that had come early in the evening.
The last of the trio added:</p>

<p>&#8220;Long-distance &#8217;phone wires here temporarily out
of order. Will call you as soon as they are repaired;
on chance your train may not yet have gone.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your party, sir,&#8221; reported the operator.</p>

<p>Curiously sick and dazed, even while his colder reason
assured him the whole affair was probably a fraud,
Conover caught up the receiver.</p>

<p>&#8220;That Magdeburg?&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;Magdeburg <i>Ho</i>tel?
This is Conover. Caleb Conover. Lady named
Shevlin there? Is she hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; came the answer, droned with maddening
indistinctness through a babel of buzzing sounds.
&#8220;Lady&#8217;s hurt pretty bad. If she ain&#8217;t dead already.
I just come on duty five minutes ago. So I don&#8217;t&mdash;Wait
a second. Gentleman wants to speak to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, through the buzz and whirr, spoke another
voice. Unmistakably Jack Hawarden&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Conover?&#8221; it called.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; yelled Caleb, driving the words by sheer
force through the horror that sanded his throat, &#8220;Go
ahead!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t even started?&#8221; cried the boy, a break
in his voice. &#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, come! Come <i>now</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>As no reply could be heard, Jack&#8217;s tones droned
on; their despair twisted by distance into a grotesque,
semi-audible squeak:</p>

<p>&#8220;She may not live through the night, the doctor
says. You see,&#8221; he rambled along, incoherently talkative
in his panic, &#8220;we were called away from the
Antlers, suddenly, by a letter telling my mother her
sister in Hampden was ill. So we all left, two weeks
earlier than we had meant. When we got to Hampden
my mother stayed there and I started back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
Granite with Miss Shevlin. We took the branch road;
and just outside of Magdeburg&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Party&#8217;s rung off long ago,&#8221; put in the operator.</p>

<p>Caleb, at Jack&#8217;s second sentence, had dropped the
receiver, bolted from the hotel and hailed a night-hawk
hansom. Already he was galloping through the
empty streets toward the station; scribbling with unsteady
hand on envelope-backs a series of orders and
dispatches that should assure him a clear track and a
record-breaking journey from the Capital to Magdeburg.
This detail arranged, his brain ceased to act.
Sense of time was wiped out. So, mercifully, was
realization of pain. In the cab of the road&#8217;s fastest
engine he crouched through the long hours of darkness;
while the wheels jolted out an irritating, meaningless
sing-song refrain that ran:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Haven&#8217;t&mdash;you&mdash;started?&mdash;For&mdash;God&#8217;s&mdash;sake,&mdash;come!</i>&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To still the hateful iteration and to rouse himself to
some semblance of calm, Caleb pulled from his side
pocket a bunch of letters brought on from his office at
Granite that same afternoon, by his secretary. He
had been busy when the package arrived and had thrust
it into his coat. Now he drew it forth and mechanically
began to glance over the envelopes.</p>

<p>It was personal mail and had been accumulating
for days. Desir&eacute;e always addressed her letters to his
hotel at the Capital; and his secretary attended to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
official mail. So Caleb had not ordered the forwarding
of such personal letters as might come to the office.
In fact he had been mildly annoyed at the secretary&#8217;s
well meant act in bringing them to him.</p>

<p>Through the small sheaf of envelopes his thick
fingers wandered. Suddenly, the man&#8217;s lack-lustre
look brightened to one of astonishment. Midway in
the package was an envelope in Desir&eacute;e Shevlin&#8217;s hand.
Letting the rest of the letters slide to the swaying
floor the Fighter nervously caught this up. Why had
she written to the office instead of to his hotel? Probably,
he thought, by mere mistake. A mistake that
meant a few moments of surcease now from his nightmare
journey.</p>

<p>With ice-damp fingers Conover held the letter; tore
it open as though the ripping of the paper caused him
physical pain; smoothed wide the pages with awkward,
awed gentleness, and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Heart&#8217;s Dearest:&mdash;Just as soon as you&#8217;ve read this,
you can come straight to see me. Honestly! For I&#8217;ll
be at home. Mrs. Hawarden&#8217;s sister is ill. We only
heard of it by this noon&#8217;s mail and we are leaving by
the night train. At first I wanted to telegraph you at
the Capital. But if I do I&#8217;m so afraid you will drop
everything and come to meet me. And you <i>mustn&#8217;t</i>.
You must stay at the Capital till you win your fight
there for all the men who have put money in Steeloid.
We are so happy we can&#8217;t afford to do anything now
to make other people blue. Can we? So stay and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
win for them. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m sending this to your
office.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have just come back to Granite all tired from
your work. Then you saw my letter and opened it
and&mdash;I&#8217;m <i>afraid</i> you&#8217;re on your way to my house
before you&#8217;ve gotten this far.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! This is the last of my little batch of
Adirondack love letters. And I believe you&#8217;re rushing
off to see me instead of reading it. And it isn&#8217;t a
love letter after all. For it&#8217;s going to be only a note.
I&#8217;ve all my packing to do and the &#8216;white-horse chariot&#8217;
comes for our trunks at six. It has been a beautiful
vacation. Two weeks of it was heaven. And the
memory of that last golden day of ours makes something
queer come into my throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m oh so glad,&mdash;so <i>glad</i>&mdash;we are coming
away. Every minute brings me nearer to Granite.
You won&#8217;t be there when I arrive; but I&#8217;ll be where
you have lived. And I&#8217;ll be waiting for you every
minute till you come back. Just thinking about you
and loving you, heart of my heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad, too, that we are leaving the Antlers before
everyone else does. It is sad, somehow, to watch
the boat-loads go off into the dark and to be part of
the dwindling group that is left. It is pleasantest to
go away from a place,&mdash;yes, and from the world, too,
I should think,&mdash;while everything is at its height; before
friends thin out and the jolly crowd falls away
and the happy, happy times begin to end. To leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
everything in the flood-tide of the fun and to remember
it as it was at its best; to be remembered as a little
part of the happiness of it all. Not as one of the few
last ones left behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a silly way to write! This isn&#8217;t a love letter
at all. I told you it wasn&#8217;t. But I had a <i>horrid</i>
dream last night and it has given me the shivers all
day. I think some of its hagorousness has crept into
my pen. No, I won&#8217;t write it. I&#8217;ll tell you all about
it when I see you. And then you can put your darling
strong arms around me and laugh at me for letting
myself get frightened by a silly dream. I wish this
was a love letter. I never wrote one till this past
week. So I don&#8217;t know how to say what I want to;
to say all the wonderful things that are in my heart.
But I <i>love</i> you, my own. And the whole world centres
just around <i>you</i>. It always has. But now that
you <i>know</i> it does, I feel so happy it frightens me.
We&#8217;re going to be together forever and ever and ever&mdash;and
ever,&mdash;and <i>then</i> some more. <i>Aren&#8217;t</i> we?
<i>Say</i> so!</p>

<p>&#8220;Say so, beloved, and hold me very tight in your
arms, very near to your heart when you say it. For
to-day I&#8217;m foolish enough to want to be comforted
a little bit. I wish I hadn&#8217;t had that dream. It was
all nonsense, <i>wasn&#8217;t</i> it? Dreams <i>never</i> come true.
So I won&#8217;t worry one minute longer. Only,&mdash;I wish
I was with you, my strong, splendid old sweetheart.
The only dream that can possibly come to pass is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
glorious one we dreamed that night up on the mountain
with the sea of mist all around us and God&#8217;s stars
overhead. And we will never wake from it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gentle, friendly northland summer is over now
and the frost lies thick nearly every morning. It is
time to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my darling, I am coming home to you.
<i>Home!</i> We must never be away from each other
again. Not for a single day;&mdash;so long as we live.&#8221;</p>

<small>&#8220;THE STRONG ARM OF CHRIST&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The sky was gray with morning as Conover stumbled
into a sitting room of the little Magdeburg Hotel.
Two men turned toward him. One of them, his arm
in a sling&mdash;a great plaster patch on his forehead and
dried blood caking his face,&mdash;hurried forward.
Caleb looked twice before he recognized Jack
Hawarden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank Heaven you&#8217;re here!&#8221; exclaimed the lad.
&#8220;She&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s alive yet?&#8221; croaked the Fighter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes! In there,&#8221; pointing to a closed door.
&#8220;Wait!&#8221; as Caleb reached the door at a bound. &#8220;Dr.
Bond is dressing some of her hurts again. He&#8217;ll be
through in a minute. Then I&#8217;ll take you in. Mr.
Conover, this is the Reverend Mr. Grant. He has
been very, very kind. He helped us lift the wreckage
from her, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she goin&#8217; to get well?&#8221; demanded Caleb, wheeling
about on the clergyman.</p>

<p>&#8220;All is being done that mortal skill can do,&#8221; answered
Mr. Grant with gentle evasion, &#8220;The local
physician&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Local physician?&#8217;&#8221; mocked Caleb. &#8220;Here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
Hawarden! Sit down there an&#8217; tel&#8217;graph to Dr.
Hawes an&#8217; Dr. Clay at Granite. Tell &#8217;em to come here
in a rush an&#8217; bring along the best nurses they can find.
Tel&#8217;graph my office in my name to give &#8217;em a Special
an&#8217; to clear the tracks for &#8217;em. Tel&#8217;graph to Noo
York, too, for the best specialists they&#8217;ve got. An&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid, sir&#8221; interposed the clergyman, &#8220;there
is no use in sending to New York. No doctor there
could reach Magdeburg&mdash;in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do&#8217;s I say!&#8221; Caleb ordered the lad. Then
turning fiercely on Mr. Grant he demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;you mean by sayin&#8217; he won&#8217;t get here on
time? She&#8217;s goin&#8217; to get well, if a couple of million
dollars worth of med&#8217;cal &#8217;tention can cure her. If
not&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If not, sir,&#8221; said the clergyman, speaking tenderly
as a father, &#8220;we must bear God&#8217;s will. For such as
she there is no fear. She has the white soul of a
child. She will go out of this lesser life of ours borne
on the strong arm of Christ. She&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No &#8216;fear&#8217; for her?&#8221; yelled Conover, catching but
a single phrase in the other&#8217;s attempt at comfort,
&#8220;Who the hell is fearin&#8217; for <i>her</i>? That girl&#8217;s fit to
look on God&#8217;s own face an&#8217; live. It&#8217;s for <i>me</i> that I&#8217;m
afraid. For <i>me</i> that I&#8217;m afraid. For <i>me</i> that she&#8217;d
leave to live on without her through all the damned
dreariness of the years. What&#8217;d there be in it for <i>me</i>
to know she was in heaven? I want <i>her</i>. I want her
<i>here</i>. With <i>me</i>! An&#8217; she&#8217;d rather be with me. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
know she would. I&#8217;d make her happier&#8217;n all the angels
that ever&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to blaspheme,&#8221; said the clergyman,
&#8220;You are not yourself. She is brave. She
knows no dread. Can&#8217;t you be as brave as she is,&mdash;for
<i>her</i> sake? She is learning that Death is no longer
terrible when one is close enough to see the kind eyes
behind the mask. I know how black an hour this is
for you. But God will help you if only you will carry
your grief to Him. When man can endure no more,
He sends Peace. If&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The door of the inner room opened, and a bearded
man emerged. He paused on the threshold at sight of
Caleb. The Fighter thrust him bodily aside, without
ceremony; entered the room the doctor had just quitted
and closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>The light burned low. In the centre of the big
white bed,&mdash;a pathetically tiny figure,&mdash;lay Desir&eacute;e.
Her wonderful hair flowed loose over the pillow. The
little face, white, pain-drawn, yet smiling joyous welcome
from its great eyes, turned eagerly toward her
lover. With an effort whose anguish left her lips
gray she stretched forth her arms to him.</p>

<p>An inarticulate, sobbing cry that rent his whole body
burst from the Fighter. The dear arms closed above
his heaving shoulders and his head lay once more on
the girl&#8217;s breast. Through the hell of his agony stole
for the moment that old, weirdly sweet sense of being
at last safe from all the noise and battle of the world;&mdash;at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
<i>home</i>. And, as a mother might hush a frightened
child, the stricken girl soothed and comforted
him; whispering secret love-words of their own; lulling
to rest the horror that was consuming him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And after a time the shock passed, bringing the
man&#8217;s inborn optimism back with a rush. This girl
who spoke so bravely, who even laughed a little in her
eagerness to comfort him,&mdash;she <i>could</i> not be at death&#8217;s
door. This local pill-mixer who had pulled so long a
face,&mdash;he and the parson chap whose business it was
to speed earth&#8217;s parting guests,&mdash;between them they
had cooked up a fine alarm. They had scared him,&mdash;they
and that fool boy who knew nothing about accidents
and whose own minor injuries no doubt made
him think Desir&eacute;e must be incurably hurt.</p>

<p>Caleb had seen many men who had been injured in
railroad smashups. They had writhed clumsily, emitting
raucous screams &#8217;way down in their throats;&mdash;or
had lain senseless in queer-shaped heaps, from the
first. Not one of them had been coherent, calm,&mdash;yes,
even cheerful,&mdash;like this worshipped little sweetheart
of his. The first shock was bringing its normal
reaction to the Fighter&#8217;s brain and nerves. As ever,
it was imparting to them a redoubled power to cast off
depression.</p>

<p>He raised his head; and, by the dim light, studied
Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s face. The brave, beautiful eyes met his
with a message of deathless love. The tortured lips
were parted in a smile.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>All at once he knew he was right. She would
get well. The enginery that had made his fortune
would not crush out her life. The railroad that had
brought him wealth was not to bring him desolation
as well. The foreknowledge set his blood to tingling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sufferin&#8217; so very much, girl?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>And she, reading his thoughts as she had always
done, smiled again as she answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very much, dear heart. Hardly at all, now
that you&#8217;re here. Oh, it&#8217;s <i>good</i> to have you with me
again! I was afraid you mightn&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped. He thought he knew why, and made
answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought I mightn&#8217;t come, hey? Why, girl, if you
had a smashed finger an&#8217; sent for me to come clear
across the world to kiss it an&#8217; make it well, I&#8217;d come.
An&#8217; you know I would. An&#8217; you&#8217;re really better since
I got here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much, much better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it!&#8221; he declared, in triumph. &#8220;I knew
you&#8217;d come &#8217;round all right. I had a hunch you would.
An&#8217; my hunches don&#8217;t ever go wrong. I&#8217;ve sent for
the best doctors in America. If there&#8217;s better doctors
in Yurrup I&#8217;ll send for those, too. An&#8217;, among &#8217;em
they&#8217;ll have you fit as a fiddle in no time. You&#8217;ll get
well, for <i>me</i>, darling. You&#8217;ll get well! You&#8217;ll get
<i>well</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>He struck his hand on the bedpost to drive home
the prophecy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear,&#8221; she whispered, faint with a new spasm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
of pain as the jar of his hand&#8217;s impact shook the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; he laughed, nervously, &#8220;I was so scared,
girl. So scared! It seemed like the world was tumblin&#8217;
about my ears. If I&#8217;d come here an&#8217; found&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He could not go on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, dear, I know!&#8221; she told him, stroking
his bristled red hair as she spoke, &#8220;It would be terribly
lonely for you if&mdash;if anything happened to me.
You are so strong in some ways. Yet in others you
are a child. No one understands you except me. No
one else can break through the rough outer-world shell
to the big gentle boy that hides inside it. If I were
not here with you, no one would ever look for that
boy. No one would even suspect he was there. And
by and by he would die for lack of companionship.
The hard rough armor would go on through life.
But the soul,&mdash;the boy I love,&mdash;would be dead. Oh,
you need me, dear! You <i>need</i> me! The poor helpless
friendly little boy behind the brutal shell,&mdash;the
real <i>you</i>,&mdash;needs me. He can&#8217;t live without me. No
one else will love him, or even know he is in his hiding
place waiting and longing to be made friends with,
<i>I can&#8217;t let you go</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>The soft voice broke, despite the gallant spirit&#8217;s
commands. And the tone went through Conover like
white-hot steel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk so, Dey!&#8221; he implored, &#8220;Don&#8217;t speak
like you weren&#8217;t goin&#8217; to get well. You <i>are</i>, I tell
you!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>&#8220;Yes, dear,&#8221; she assented once more, petting the
big awkward hand that clung to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you are,&#8221; he protested valiantly, &#8220;It&#8217;s
crazy of me to a&#8217; thought anything else. An&#8217; I didn&#8217;t,
really. You&#8217;ll be as well as ever you was, in a week
or less. I&#8217;m havin&#8217; nurses tel&#8217;graphed for, too. The
best there are. An&#8217;,&#8221; a veritable inspiration crossing
the brain he was racking for further words of encouragement,
&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;ve got a present for you. A
dandy one. Guess what it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Flowers?&#8221; she asked, forcing an interest into her
query.</p>

<p>&#8220;Flowers!&#8221; he echoed in fine scorn, &#8220;Somethin&#8217;
nicer&#8217;n all the flowers that ever happened! See!&#8221;</p>

<p>He fished from his waistcoat pocket a little box
wrapped with tissue paper that was none the cleaner
for a week&#8217;s companionship with tobacco-dust and lead
pencils.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let me open it!&#8221; she commanded, with a vestige
of her old sweet imperiousness. &#8220;That&#8217;s the best
part of a present.&#8221;</p>

<p>She undid the grimy paper, opened the box and
gazed in childish delight at the gorgeous diamond in its
platinum setting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you&#8217;d like it,&#8221; he chuckled, &#8220;Han&#8217;somest
ring in New York. From the best store there, too.
See the name on the box-cover. How&#8217;s <i>that</i> for an
engagement ring?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s beautiful! Beautiful!&#8221; she murmured.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>She slipped it on her third finger, whence it hung
heavy and ridiculously loose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s a little too large,&#8221; he confessed, &#8220;But
we&#8217;ll have that fixed easily enough. I didn&#8217;t want to
ask your size beforehand for fear you might suspect
somethin&#8217;. So I had to guess at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She praised the diamond&#8217;s beauties until even Conover
was content. Then she lay back among the pillows
and fought movelessly for endurance. Her
waning strength, keyed up to its highest pitch for
Caleb&#8217;s sake, was deserting her. To hide her weakness
she began playing with the ring; slipping it from
finger to finger until at length the circlet hung loose
from her thumb. Caleb watched her slender hand
toying with the gift.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be a mighty short time, now,&#8221; said he, &#8220;before
we fit on a plain gold ring above that! Hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>At his words the girl, to his dismay, broke into a
passion of tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;There! <i>There!</i>&#8221; he consoled, passing his arms
about the frail tormented body, &#8220;Why, what is it,
sweetheart? Too much excitement after your accident?
I ought to a&#8217; had better sense than to keep you
talkin&#8217; like this. Try an&#8217; get some sleep. An&#8217; when
you wake up you&#8217;ll feel better. Lots better. Don&#8217;t
cry! It breaks me all up to have you do it. <i>Don&#8217;t</i>,
precious!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I love you so,&#8221; panted the girl, &#8220;There&#8217;s just
you in all the world, Caleb! You&#8217;ll stay close by me
<i>always</i>, won&#8217;t you? Just as long as I live?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>&#8220;You bet I will!&#8221; he declared, &#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;ll never let
you out of my sight. I ain&#8217;t more&#8217;n half myself when
you&#8217;re away. I need you worse&#8217;n you can ever need
me, Dey. You&#8217;re just the heart of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take your arms away,&#8221; she begged, &#8220;They
are so strong, so safe. Listen, dear:&mdash;I want you to
pick me up,&mdash;I&#8217;m not too heavy, am I?&mdash;Pick me up
and carry me. I want to be close to you,&mdash;closer than
I ever was before. You are so big,&mdash;so powerful.
And&mdash;I feel so weak. I&#8217;m a little restless; that&#8217;s
all,&#8221; she added hastily, &#8220;And it will quiet me to be
held.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gathered her gently to his breast. Her arms
clasped his neck; her face was buried in his shoulder
to stifle the cry of agony evoked by the movement of
lifting. Then, carrying her closely to his heart,
Conover began to pace the room, bearing the girl as
easily and as lightly as though she were a baby.</p>

<p>The tenderness of his caress now held no roughness.
The motion and the reliance on his perfect strength
quieted her suffering and gave her the sense of utter
peace she had known when she fell asleep in his arms
on the Adirondack hilltop.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am <i>very</i> happy!&#8221; she sighed, &#8220;Do I tire you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much you don&#8217;t, you little bit of a girl!&#8221; he
laughed, &#8220;I could carry you always. An&#8217; I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
to. Right close in my heart. Say, there was a man
out in the other room when I came. A minister. He
said a queer thing. Somethin&#8217; &#8217;bout bein&#8217; carried on
the &#8216;strong arm of Christ.&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>&#8220;I think I know what he meant,&#8221; said Desir&eacute;e,
softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! Sometime when you&#8217;re better I&#8217;ll get
you to explain it to me. I&#8217;d rather talk &#8217;bout you,
just now. D&#8217;you remember that time I sat by the
fire an&#8217; held you like this while you went to sleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I <i>remember</i>?&#8221; she answered, &#8220;There has
never been one hour I&#8217;ve forgotten it. It made me
feel so safe from harm; so sure, so happy. Perhaps,&mdash;yes,
I&#8217;m <i>sure</i>&mdash;that&#8217;s the way one must feel
when&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you thinkin&#8217; &#8217;bout what that preacher said?&#8221;
asked Caleb, miserably, &#8220;Don&#8217;t, girl! It&#8217;ll be years
and years before you ever need to think &#8217;bout those
things. A month from now we&#8217;ll both laugh over the
scare I had.... Your eyes get wonderfuller all
the time, Dey. I never knew quite how lovely they
were till now. There&#8217;s a light in &#8217;em like they was
lookin&#8217; at somethin&#8217; a common chap like me couldn&#8217;t
see.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew his head down and their lips met in a long
kiss. As he raised his face he half-fancied she whispered
some word; but he could not catch its purport.</p>

<p>He resumed his pacing to and fro. After a time
Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s lashes drooped. Her quick breathing grew
slow and regular.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think&mdash;anyone could&mdash;be so&mdash;happy,&#8221;
she murmured, drowsily. &#8220;It&#8217;s sweet to&mdash;to rest&mdash;in
your arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bent to kiss her on the forehead. The brow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
that had been so hot to his first touch was cool and
moist.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re better already!&#8221; he cried in delight.
&#8220;Say, sweetheart, I got an idea. To-morrow let&#8217;s get
that preacher chap to marry us. Shan&#8217;t we? Then as
soon as you get well enough, we&#8217;ll go somewhere for
the dandiest weddin&#8217; trip on record. To Yurrup, if
you like. Or back to the Antlers. Or anywhere you
say. An&#8217; I&#8217;ll buy you the prettiest clo&#8217;es in all Noo
York; an&#8217; you can get a whole cartload of joolry, if
you like. I&#8217;d pay ev&#8217;ry cent I got in the world to keep
that wonderful, happy light in those big eyes of yours.
Will you marry me to-morrow, girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>Desir&eacute;e did not answer. She was asleep. On tiptoe,
Caleb crossed to the bed. He laid her down upon
it, smoothing the hot tumbled pillows with his unaccustomed
hand. Then he tiptoed with ponderous
softness out of the room and closed the door silently
behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; he exclaimed gleefully, addressing Jack
and the doctor who were consulting at the far end of
the next room. &#8220;Guess I had my fright for nothin&#8217;!
She&#8217;ll get on fine. She&#8217;s sound asleep, an&#8217; her forehead&#8217;s&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the morphia I gave her to deaden the pain,&#8221;
said the doctor. &#8220;If she had not been suffering so
terribly it would have taken effect before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Morphia? Sufferin&#8217;?&#8221; repeated Caleb. &#8220;Why,
she&#8217;s hardly sufferin&#8217; at all. Told me so, herself.
Look here!&#8221; he went on, bullyingly, as he advanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
on the physician, &#8220;D&#8217;ye mean to say there&#8217;s a chance
she <i>won&#8217;t</i> get well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no earthly power,&#8221; retorted the doctor,
nettled at the domineering tone, &#8220;that can keep her
alive ten hours longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You lie! Don&#8217;t I know&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot thrash you in the anteroom of death,&#8221;
answered the doctor, &#8220;and I take your sorrow into
consideration. But what I just said is true. Miss
Shevlin has sustained internal injuries which cannot
but prove fatal. Nothing but her yearning to see you
again has kept her alive as long as this. It is best to
be frank.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caleb was eyeing him stupidly. At last he turned to
Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you send those tel&#8217;grams?&#8221; he asked; and his
voice was dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; replied Hawarden. &#8220;I sent them,
but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I told him it was useless,&#8221; put in the doctor.
&#8220;There is not a fighting chance. She will not come
out of this morphia stupor. The moisture on her
forehead is what you laymen would call the &#8216;death-sweat.&#8217;
She&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You lie!&#8221; broke forth Caleb, beside himself.
&#8220;You may fool women and children by your damn
profess&#8217;nal airs, but it don&#8217;t go down with <i>me</i>. I&#8217;ve
seen folks die. An&#8217; they ain&#8217;t sane an&#8217; cheerful an&#8217;
bright like Dey Shevlin was just now. You quacks
make a livin&#8217; by throwin&#8217; med&#8217;cines you don&#8217;t half understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
into systems you don&#8217;t understand at all. As
long&#8217; it&#8217;s a triflin&#8217; case of mumps or headache, you
look all-fired wise an&#8217; write out p&#8217;scriptions in a furren
language to hide your ignor&#8217;nce. But when anything&#8217;s
reely the matter you&#8217;re as helpless as a drunken longshoreman.
If the patient dies from your blunders an&#8217;
from the dope you throw hap-hazard into him, he
&#8216;hadn&#8217;t a chance from the start.&#8217; If he gets well in
spite of you, it&#8217;s your almighty skill that &#8216;pulled him
through.&#8217; When a feller gets colic an&#8217; you call it
appendicitis, what do you do? You don&#8217;t rest till you
get a chance to stick your knives into him. If he gets
well, it&#8217;s a &#8216;mir&#8217;cle of modern surgery.&#8217; If he croaks,
the &#8216;op&#8217;ration was a success,&#8217;&mdash;only the patient got
peevish an&#8217; died. There never yet was an appendicitis
case where the quack in charge didn&#8217;t say there&#8217; a
been &#8216;no hope if the op&#8217;ration had been delayed another
two hours.&#8217; Oh, you&#8217;re a fine lot of fakers an&#8217;
gold-brick con men, you doctors! An&#8217; now you say
my little girl&#8217;s dyin&#8217;! God damn your soul, I tell you
again you <i>lie</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor picked up his black bag without replying
and moved toward the outer door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where you goin&#8217;?&#8221; demanded Caleb.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going home,&#8221; was the stiff retort. &#8220;I drop
this case. I do not care to be associated longer with a
wild beast like&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were choked in his mouth. At a spring,
Conover had cleared the space between them, had
caught the physician by the throat and was shaking him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
back and forth with jerks that threatened to snap the
victim&#8217;s spine. Then he hurled him to the centre of
the room and towered over him, ablaze with fury.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m a wild beast, all right!&#8221; he snarled.
&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;m li&#8217;ble to become a hom&#8217;cidal one at that.
&#8216;Drop the case,&#8217; would you? Sneak out an&#8217; leave that
poor kid in there to lose what chance she might have
from your help? Well, Mr. Doctor, if you take one
step out into that hall, the next step you take&#8217;ll be in
hell. What&#8217;s more, you&#8217;ll go back to that sick room,
right now; an&#8217; you&#8217;ll work over Miss Shevlin like you
never worked before. If I catch you neglectin&#8217; her or
tryin&#8217; to get away,&mdash;by the Eternal, I&#8217;ll tear you in
half with my bare hands! Now <i>go</i>! Go in there!&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor, his rage tempered by the memory of the
iron fingers on his windpipe, glared at the madman in
angry irresolution. Caleb&#8217;s muscles tightened ominously.
The physician recoiled a step in most unprofessional
haste.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a dangerous maniac!&#8221; he said somewhat
unsteadily, &#8220;and you shall go to prison for this outrageous
assault. For the present, I shall remain on
the case. Not because of your threats, but from common
humanity toward&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Toward yourself,&#8221; finished Caleb, satisfied that he
had won his point. &#8220;An&#8217; just to make sure, I&#8217;ll lock
the outer door of this suite an&#8217; pocket the key. Now
go back to your patient!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Outside, there was glaring, heartless sunshine. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
the sick room stood Caleb and Jack, one on either side
of the bed over which the doctor was bending. With
closed eyes, Desir&eacute;e Shevlin rested where Conover had
laid her. For hours she had lain thus.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can do no more,&#8221; pronounced the doctor, rising
and meeting Caleb&#8217;s glazed eye. &#8220;The end may come
now at any moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Fighter, his every faculty drowned in the horrible
egotism of grief, made no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;If only there were someone to pray!&#8221; muttered
Jack, battling to keep back the tears. &#8220;I wish Mr.
Grant was&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray?&#8221; echoed Caleb, rousing himself and clutching
at the faint hope. &#8220;It can&#8217;t do any harm. Pray,
man! <i>Pray!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I <i>can&#8217;t</i>!&#8221; babbled the boy. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
how. I never prayed in my life. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try it!&#8221; groaned Caleb. &#8220;<i>Try</i> it, I say! You
may have beginner&#8217;s luck!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No use!&#8221; interposed the doctor. &#8220;It&#8217;s over.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, Desir&eacute;e stirred ever so slightly. Her
closed eyes opened. She seemed to settle lower in the
bed. Then she lay very still.</p>

<p>With a sobbing cry Jack Hawarden rushed from
the room. Conover stood, dumb, petrified, staring
wildly down into the unseeing, all-seeing eyes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br />


<small>THE LAST FIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Under the concentrated anguish of Conover&#8217;s gaze
the girl&#8217;s long lashes seemed to flicker ever so slightly.
Through the Gethsemane of the moment the impossible
fancy that she lived pierced Caleb&#8217;s numbed brain;
tearing away the apathy that was closing over him.
All at once he was again the Fighter,&mdash;the man who
could not know defeat.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is alive!&#8221; he persisted as the physician turned
from the bed. &#8220;Look! She&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Bond&#8217;s bearded lip curled in a sad derision that
woke Caleb&#8217;s smouldering antagonism into flame.
With a sudden insane impulse the Fighter knelt on the
edge of the bed and caught up the pitifully still little
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Dey!</i>&#8221; he cried, his great rough voice echoing
through the dreadful hush of the room.</p>

<p>Bond opened his mouth to protest; then shrank back
to the wall, staring in heavy wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Dey!</i>&#8221; called the Fighter again, an agony of command
in his tone. &#8220;Dey! <i>Come back!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not the wail of a weak nature vainly summoning
the Lost to return. Rather it was the sharp,
fierce call of the officer who by sheer force of accepted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
rulership rallies his stricken men. Sublimely imperious,
backed by a will of chilled steel and by a mentality
that had never been successfully balked, the
Fighter&#8217;s voice resounded again and again in that
harsh, domineering order:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Dey! Come back!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Calling upon his seemingly dead love to re-enter the
frail flesh she was even now quitting, Conover threw
into his appeal all the vast strength that was his and
the immeasurably enforced power of his despair and
adoration. He held the white hands gripped tight to
his chest; his face close to the silent girl&#8217;s; his light
eyes blazing into hers; his every faculty bent with
superhuman pressure upon drawing an answering sign
from the lifeless form.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is madness!&#8221; muttered the doctor; infected
nevertheless by the dominant magnetism that played
about the Fighter and that vibrated through every
tone of his imperative voice. &#8220;It is madness. She
is dead, or&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Conover did not heed nor hear. He had no consciousness
for anything save this supreme battle of his
whole life. Vaguely he knew that the innate mastership
within him which for years had subdued strong
men to his will had been as nothing to the nameless
power that love was now enabling him to put forth.</p>

<p>From the threshold of death,&mdash;yes, from the grave
itself,&mdash;she should come at his call; this little, silent
wisp of humanity that meant life and heaven to him.</p>

<p>The red-haired man was fighting.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>He had always been fighting. But the fiercest of his
campaigns had hitherto been as child&#8217;s play by comparison
with this contest with the Unknown. Once
again he was &#8220;taking the Kingdom of Heaven by violence!&#8221;
This time literally.</p>

<p>The mad whim had possessed him through no conscious
volition of his own; and he had acted upon it
without reflection. He was matching his mortal
power against the Infinite.</p>

<p>He was doing what Science knew could not be done;
what the most hysterical spiritualist had never claimed
power to achieve. He was trying, by force of personality
and sheer desire, to check the flight of a soul
upon the Borderland.</p>

<p>And over and over again his voice swelled, untiring,
through the room, in that one all-compelling demand:&mdash;a
demand that held no note of entreaty, nor of
aught else save utter, fierce domination.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Dey! Come back!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor, scared, irresolute, slipped from the
room. This type of mania was outside his experience.
In time it would wear itself out. In the meanwhile,
his nerves could not endure the sound of that ceaseless
calling; the sight of the tense, furiously masterful
face.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was two hours later that Dr. Colfax, the first of
the summoned New York specialists, arrived. Jack
Hawarden met him at the entrance of the hotel and
briefly explained the case.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; the boy added, &#8220;you would go in and see
what you can do for Mr. Conover. I&#8217;m afraid he has
lost his mind. I looked into the room several times
and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He shuddered at the picture conjured up. His
nerves had gone to pieces.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was terrible,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t dare interrupt
him. He was crouching there, holding her
close to him and looking at her as if he&#8217;d drag her spirit
by main force back into her body. And all the time
he was saying over and over&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go up,&#8221; said the specialist, cutting in on the
narrative. &#8220;Even if the local physician did not complete
a full examination to make sure she was dead,
such insane treatment would destroy any chance of
life. Show me the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Together they entered the sick room. Conover had
not stirred. Through the closed door they had heard
the hoarse rumble of his eternal command:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Dey! Come back!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Colfax walked briskly across to the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221; he said, addressing Caleb in the sharp
tones used for arousing the delirious. &#8220;This won&#8217;t
do! You must&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused; his first idle glance at Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s pale face
changing in a flash to one of keen professional interest.
He caught one of her wrists, at the point where
it was engulfed in Caleb&#8217;s great hand; held it for an
instant; then, turning, flung open his black medical
case.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>Jack, who had lingered at the door, hurried forward
on tiptoe.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean&mdash;?&#8221; he whispered quaveringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The local physician was mistaken,&#8221; returned Dr. Colfax
in the same key. &#8220;Or she&mdash;&#8221; he hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard of such cases,&#8221; he murmured, in wonder.
&#8220;But I only know of two that are authentic. It
is more probable that she was merely in a collapse. I
can inquire later.&#8221;</p>

<p>While he talked, he had been selecting and filling a
hypodermic needle. Now, stepping past Conover,
who had not noted the newcomers&#8217; presence, he pressed
the needle-point into Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s forearm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You really think then&mdash;?&#8221; cried Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it is worth a fight!&#8221; snapped the doctor.
&#8220;Go down and see if my nurse has come. I left her at
the station. She could not walk as fast as I. Go
out quietly. This man doesn&#8217;t even know we are here,
but I don&#8217;t want to take any chance just yet of breaking
his &#8216;influence.&#8217; Time enough for that when the
digitalis begins to act.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Caleb Conover stretched himself and sat up. He
felt oddly weak and depressed. For the first time in
his life he was tired out.</p>

<p>For twenty hours he had slept. The afternoon sun
was pouring in at the windows. Caleb glanced stupidly
about him and recognized the anteroom leading
off from the sick chamber. Vaguely at first, then
more clearly, he recalled that someone&mdash;ever and ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
so long ago&mdash;had shaken him by the shoulder and
had repeated over and over in his ears &#8220;<i>She is alive!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, at last the iterated words of command that
had been saying themselves through his own lips for
three hours had somehow ceased, and something in
his head had given way. He had lurched into the
anteroom, tumbled over on a sofa and had fallen
asleep at once from sheer exhaustion. And Dey&mdash;?</p>

<p>Weakly cursing the gross selfishness that had let
him sleep like a log while Desir&eacute;e&#8217;s life had hung in
the balance Conover got to his feet and made for the
door of the sick room. His step was springless,
clumping, noisy. Dr. Colfax, hearing it, came out
from the inner room to meet him. Caleb gazed at the
man with dull vacancy. He did not remember having
seen him before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss&mdash;Miss Shevlin?&#8221; asked Conover, thickly;
his throat agonizingly raw from the long hours of tireless,
unremittent calling.</p>

<p>&#8220;She will get well, I think,&#8221; answered the specialist.
&#8220;The crisis is past. The spine was not injured. But
convalescence will be slow. Nursing is the only thing
left to do now. I am leaving for New York by the
six o&#8217;clock train.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caleb&#8217;s apathetic look slowly changed to deep, growing
wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; went on Dr. Colfax, watching Conover,
narrowly, &#8220;it may be barely possible that you can
thank yourself for her recovery. Perhaps I am mistaken.
You see we doctors deal with <i>facts</i>. But,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
once in a century something happens outside the realm
of fact. Mind you, I don&#8217;t go on record as saying
this is one of those exceptions. But&mdash;I should like
to ask you some questions when you are rested enough
to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By and by,&#8221; assented Caleb. &#8220;But I&#8217;m going in
there to see Dey now, if you don&#8217;t mind. Can I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. She has been asking for you. Be careful
not to excite her, or&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be careful,&#8221; promised Caleb.</p>

<p>Then, with a sheepish laugh, he added:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you didn&#8217;t make me put up a fight about
goin&#8217; in to see her. I&mdash;I kind of feel as if there
wasn&#8217;t any fight left in me.&#8221;</p>

By Charles Klein, and Arthur Hornblow. With illustrations

greater than the play. A portentous clash of dominant personalities

briefly in the short space of four acts. All this is narrated in the
novel with a wealth of fascinating and absorbing detail, making it one
of the most powerfully written and exciting works of fiction given to
the world in years.</p>

<p class="p3">How the doctor came to the bleak Labrador coast and there in saving

etching of a sturdy fisher people, and above all in the echoes of the

pathos, and the sad grotesque conjunctions of old and new civilizations
are expressed through the medium of a style that has distinction
and strikes a note of rare personality.</p>

<p class="p3">Every chapter in the book has been revised by a specialist. The
author clearly brings out the full value that is to be derived from intensive
culture and intelligent methods given to small land holdings.
Given untrammelled opportunity, agriculture will not only care well
for itself and for those intelligently engaged in it, but it will give
stability to all other industries and pursuits. (<i>From the Preface.</i>)
&#8220;The author piles fact upon authenticated instance and successful
experiment upon proved example, until there is no doubt what can
be done with land intensively treated. He shows where the land
may be found, what kind we must have, what it will cost, and what
to do with it. It is seldom we find so much enthusiasm tempered
by so much experience and common sense. The book points out in
a practical way the possibilities of a very small farm intensively cultivated.
It embodies the results of actual experience and it is intended
to be workable in every detail.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Providence Journal.</i></p>

<p>Superb color portraits of many familiar flowers in

series. By their aid alone the novice can name the

<p>Intimate life-histories of over five hundred species
of wild flowers, written in untechnical, vivid language,
emphasize the marvelously interesting and
vital relationship existing between these flowers and
the special insect to which each is adapted.</p>

<p class="p3">The flowers are divided into five color groups, because
by this arrangement anyone with no knowledge
of botany whatever can readily identify the
specimens met during a walk. The various popular
names by which each species is known, its preferred
dwelling-place, months of blooming and geographical
distribution follow its description. Lists of berry-bearing
and other plants most conspicuous after the
flowering season, of such as grow together in different
kinds of soil, and finally of family groups arranged
by that method of scientific classification
adopted by the International Botanical Congress
which has now superseded all others, combine to

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
